# [M-2]: Interest Accrual during Paused State

## Summary
Accrual of Interest on Outstanding Debt During Paused State in the Protocol
## Vulnerability Detail
In the protocol, when the system is paused, actions such as `borrowing`, `withdrawing`, and `repaying` are temporarily halted to manage risk during emergency situations. However, despite the paused state, interest continues to accrue on existing debt according to the contract's interest rate model. The accrue function is still called periodically (or whenever necessary) to update the pool’s debt with the accumulated interest, even though no new borrow or repay actions are allowed.
## Impact
The continuous accrual of interest during a paused state introduces several risks and fairness issues:

**Unfair Liquidations:** Users who become underwater during the pause are at risk of liquidation once the protocol is unpaused, even though they had no opportunity to manage or adjust their positions.

**Unjust Financial Burden:** Users are required to pay interest accrued during the pause, even though they were unable to repay or manage their debt due to the paused state. Changes to the interest rate model or fees during the pause can further exacerbate this issue, as users would be subject to new terms that they had no ability to account for.



This mechanism can lead to two potentially unfair scenarios for users:

**Scenario 1:** A user deposits collateral into the pool, which then gets paused. During the paused state, the value of the collateral might drop, causing the user’s position to become underwater. Once the protocol is unpaused, a liquidator could front-run the user and liquidate the position, or the user may be forced to repay accrued interest that accumulated during the paused state, which could feel unjust given that they had no control over the situation.

**Scenario 2:** A user takes out a loan, and the protocol is subsequently paused due to unforeseen circumstances. During this pause, the protocol’s administrators decide to change the interest fee or the interest rate model. Once the changes are implemented and the protocol is unpaused, the user is then forced to pay the interest that accrued during the paused state, even though they could not repay or manage their debt during that time.

## Recommendation
To address these issues, consider implementing the following solutions:

**Pause Interest Accrual:** During a paused state, interest accrual on outstanding debt should also be paused. This can prevent users from being unfairly burdened by interest payments they had no control over. Accrual should resume only once the protocol is unpaused.

**Grace Period for Users:** After unpausing the protocol, provide users with a grace period during which they can adjust their positions or repay their loans without facing immediate liquidation or additional penalties. This grace period should account for any changes made to the interest rate model or fees during the pause.
