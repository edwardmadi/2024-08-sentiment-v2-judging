# Missing Revert in `_supplyToPools` Can Lead to Inconsistent Asset Handling


## Reference
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L524
## Summary
The `_supplyToPools` function attempts to distribute assets across multiple pools sequentially. However, unlike the `_withdrawFromPools` function, it does not revert if deposits cannot be completed successfully, resulting in potential inconsistencies where assets remain unallocated within the contract. This could lead to issues such as under-utilization of liquidity and unexpected behavior in asset management operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_supplyToPools` function includes logic to iterate through the deposit queue and attempt deposits into the associated pools. If the deposit fails (e.g., due to cap limits), the function catches the error using a try/catch block and moves to the next pool. While this prevents the function from reverting immediately, it fails to check at the end if all deposit attempts were unsuccessful.

The function structure is as follows:

```solidity
try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
    assets -= supplyAmt;
} catch { }
```
After all pools are iterated, if assets remains non-zero, this indicates that some or all deposits failed. Unlike `_withdrawFromPools`, there is no final check and revert mechanism for this case, leading to a situation where unallocated assets remain within the contract. The protocol might assume that assets have been correctly deposited when they have not.  The unallocated assets could cause liquidity management issues if they are not accounted for correctly. The assets left unhandled could be misinterpreted as idle funds, leading to improper decision-making regarding the pool’s overall liquidity.
## Impact
The missing revert can lead to situations where assets are not deposited as expected but are still considered allocated. This can cause accounting errors, misalignment in the expected liquidity, and potentially affect the security guarantees of the protocol’s operation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, introduce a final check to revert the transaction if all pools fail to accept the assets.
