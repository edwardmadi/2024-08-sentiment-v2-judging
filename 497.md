# Immediate withdrawal after a deposit in the same block is not possible in POOL

### Summary

The way shares are calculated during deposit in the pool contract and the way it is calculated during withdrawal, leads to situation where immediate withdrawal is not possible 

### Root Cause

In the Pool.deposit function, the function allows deposits of assets to the specified poolId, but a problem occurs in the way the shares to be minted are calculated, in contrast to the way shares to burn in Pool.withdraw are calculated , as shown below 
[Pool.deposit::L323](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L322C9-L328C41)
```solidity
 shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroSharesDeposit(poolId, assets);
        pool.totalDepositAssets += assets;
        pool.totalDepositShares += shares;
        _mint(receiver, poolId, shares);
```
Here the shares are calculated and Rounded Down, which means the shares that are going to be allocated to the user and minted are rounded down, 
But the same did not happen in the withdraw function as shown below 
[Pool.withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L350C9-L367C38)
```solidity
shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Up);
...more code

pool.totalDepositAssets -= assets;
        pool.totalDepositShares -= shares;

        _burn(owner, poolId, shares);
``` 
You have a situation where the minted shares are smaller than the shares that are subtracted from `pool.totalDepositShares -= shares` and the _burn will attempt to subtract the shares here from the minted shares in deposit Leading to a revert
[ERC6909](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/lib/ERC6909.sol#L102C5-L106C6)
```solidity
function _burn(address sender, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        balanceOf[sender][id] -= amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, sender, address(0), id, amount);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- users must deposit assets to a specific poolId
- there must be enough balance of asset and must attempt to withdraw in the same block, or within a very short time frame
- the minted shares in deposit and the calculated shares in withdraw need to be different 


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The Rounding operations, would affect withdrawals if users try to withdraw the same amount of assets they deposited within a short period of time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The direction of rounding of deposits and withdrawals should be implemented to go in the same direction
