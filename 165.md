# Borrower can not be liquidated if he has only USDC or USDT as collateral and it is paused.

## Summary
```liquidate()``` function will always revert if USDC or USDT is used as the only collateral and it is paused leading to protocol insolvency .

## Vulnerability Detail
During every liquidation, borrower's collateral is taken from his Position and transfered to the liquidator. We can see the implementation of ```liquidate()``` here :
```solidity
    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
        riskEngine.validateLiquidation(position, debtData, assetData);

        // liquidate
@>        _transferAssetsToLiquidator(position, assetData);
        _repayPositionDebt(position, debtData);

        // position should be within risk thresholds after liquidation
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
        emit Liquidation(position, msg.sender, ownerOf[position]);
    }

    function _transferAssetsToLiquidator(address position, AssetData[] calldata assetData) internal {
        // transfer position assets to the liquidator and accrue protocol liquidation fees
        uint256 assetDataLength = assetData.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < assetDataLength; ++i) {
            // ensure assetData[i] is in the position asset list
            if (Position(payable(position)).hasAsset(assetData[i].asset) == false) {
                revert PositionManager_SeizeInvalidAsset(position, assetData[i].asset);
            }
            // compute fee amt
            // [ROUND] liquidation fee is rounded down, in favor of the liquidator
            uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
            // transfer fee amt to protocol
@>            Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
            // transfer difference to the liquidator
@>            Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
        }
    }
```

However, since it is possible for borrower to set USDC or USDT for collateral and these ERC20 can be paused at the will of their owners, the borrower can take advantage of the pause event and borrow risk free from liquidations since all transfer outs will be reverted. This, basically, means that he can be under-collateralized and not  In the better case for the borrower, if the value of the paused USDC/USDT which he has as collateral drops below the value of borrowed amount(or, more possibly, the ```borrowAmount``` with interest accrued increases a lo t), the liquidator bots of Sentiment can liquidate his bad debt without revert since the transfer out is in try/catch block. We can see the implementation here :
```solidity
    function liquidateBadDebt(address position) external onlyOwner {
        riskEngine.validateBadDebt(position);

        // transfer any remaining position assets to the PositionManager owner
        address[] memory positionAssets = Position(payable(position)).getPositionAssets();
        uint256 positionAssetsLength = positionAssets.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < positionAssetsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 amt = IERC20(positionAssets[i]).balanceOf(position);
@>            try Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), positionAssets[i], amt) { } catch { }
        }

        // clear all debt associated with the given position
        uint256[] memory debtPools = Position(payable(position)).getDebtPools();
        uint256 debtPoolsLength = debtPools.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < debtPoolsLength; ++i) {
            pool.rebalanceBadDebt(debtPools[i], position);
            Position(payable(position)).repay(debtPools[i], type(uint256).max);
        }
    }
```

In this case, borrower's debt will be deleted while the collateral will stay in his Position. Then, he is able to borrow again on the same collateral which was supposed to be seized. In any case, a borrower can take advantage of the pause of USDC or USDT and put them as only collaterals to avoid liquidations. 

## Impact
This vulnerability allows borrowers to take advantage of the pausing of USDC or USDT to avoid liquidation, potentially leading to significant losses for lenders. If the token is paused and it is used as the only collateral, the liquidation process reverts, leaving the borrower’s debt intact while preventing the transfer of collateral to the liquidator(since it is paused). In cases where the ```Position``` becomes insolvent(debt > collateral), the borrower’s position will probably be liquidated by Sentiment bots without transferring the collateral back, resulting in the collateral remaining in the borrower’s position while his debt is erased.

## Code Snippet
Here is the ```liquidate()``` function which will revert if USDC or USDT pause : 
```solidity
function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
        riskEngine.validateLiquidation(position, debtData, assetData);

        // liquidate
@>        _transferAssetsToLiquidator(position, assetData);
        _repayPositionDebt(position, debtData);

        // position should be within risk thresholds after liquidation
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
        emit Liquidation(position, msg.sender, ownerOf[position]);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The fix of this vulnerability could be "marking" the seized collaterals which didn't transferred out from the Position during the ```liquidateBadDebt()``` call, and when the ERC20 unpauses take them.
