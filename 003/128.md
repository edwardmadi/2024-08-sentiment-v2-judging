# SuperPool inherits pausable but none of the functions have the `whenNotPaused` modifier

### Summary

The SuperPool inherits the [Pausable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/25a0c8aeaddec273c5318540059165696591ecfb/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L25) contract and has a `togglePause()` to pause the contract

The issue is that none of the functions have the `whenNotPaused` modifier to revert when the contract is paused. As a result the `togglePause()` function essentially does nothing

### Root Cause

Not adding `whenNotPaused` modifier to functions

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In case of an exploit, or any other reason the owner cannot pause the superpool

Togglepause will have no effect

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the core functions like `deposit` and `mint`
