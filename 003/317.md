# The issue regarding the missing pause functionality has not been resolved.



## Summary
The issue regarding the missing pause functionality has not been resolved.
## Vulnerability Detail
SuperPool contract inherits from Pausable contract, does not use the whenNotPaused.
```javascript
    /// @notice Toggle pause state of the SuperPool
    function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```
The SuperPool contract implements the ability to toggle the paused state, but it does not enforce the pause functionality in critical functions.
## Impact
The owner lacks the ability to pause the protocol in emergency situations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the relevant functions to ensure they can only be executed when the contract is not paused.
