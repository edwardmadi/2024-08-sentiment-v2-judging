# Functions in superPool do not check if the pool is paused

## Summary
All the functions in the superPool can be accessed even when the pool is paused.
## Vulnerability Detail
SuperPool is supposed to be a pausable contract and it will be paused when ever required, but the functions, `deposit` , `mint` , `withdraw` ,  and `redeem` and many more do not actually have a check to see if the pool is paused or not and due to which these functions will be accessed even when the pool is paused.
## Impact
Users will suffer a loss if they try to withdraw during the pool paused scenario.
