# Pausing on SuperPool doesn't work

## Summary
Eventhough the `superPool.sol` contract inherits from openZepplin pausable contract and implements functions to pause the contract like `togglePause()`, none of the `superPool.sol` functions have the `whenNotPaused` modifier which will actually implement the pausing functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `superPool.sol` contract allows the superPool owner to pause the contact through the `togglePause()` function, which will call openzepplin `Pausable._pause()` in order to pause the contract. 
```solidity
    function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```
The contract however fails to actually implement the pausing functionality through the use of the available `whenNotPaused` modifier or checking if the contract is paused in any of the contract functions. 

## Impact
Even though pausing is implemented in the contract. When the admin calls `togglePause()` no contract function will be paused, meaning pausing doesn't work at all in the `superPool.sol` contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend that the protocol add the `whenNotPaused` to user facing functions like `withdraw()` and `deposit()`.
