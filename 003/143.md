# `SuperPool` has the ability to be paused but does not stop any functions when pausing it

## Summary

Due to missing checks to ensure whether the contract is paused or not, execution cannot be stopped during emergency.

## Vulnerabily Detail

The `SuperPool` contract inherits from [OZ's Pausable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Pausable.sol) contract and also implements a function to pause the contract.
```solidity
    function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```

However, none of the functions in the contract present a check to ensure stopping execution when the contract is paused.

## Impact

During an emergency the owner of `SuperPool` will not be able to pause it.

## Recommendation

Add `Pausable::whenNotPaused` modifier to functions that need their execution stopped during emergency.
