# Users can still deposit in the SuperPool when it's paused

### Summary

The SuperPool can be paused but the deposit and withdraw don't check it making it useless.

### Root Cause

The function [`togglePause()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/src/SuperPool.sol#L164-L164) can pause the `SuperPool` contract.

But the functions `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()` and `redeem()` don't check if the SuperPool is paused. 
This can be an issue if the Owner paused the pool because an issue happened as users will still be able to interact with it making the pause useless.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner pause the SuperPool.

### External pre-conditions

1. Issue with the SuperPool (e.g. one of the pool suffer bad debt or a hack happen).
