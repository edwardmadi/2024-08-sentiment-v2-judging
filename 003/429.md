# Ineffective implementation of the pause mechanism in the Superpool

## Summary
The Superpool contract implements the openzeppelin pausable contract to have a control over state changes within the pool. However this pause mechanism is not properly implemented.
## Vulnerability Details
The Toggle pause function effectively turns on/off the pause, but the `whenNotPaused` modifier is not implemented on any of the functions, as a result in a paused state Lenders can continuously influence the state of the contract in their favour.
## Impact
The Superpool owner will have no control over state changes in the pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `withdraw` and `deposit` functions especially, should have the `whenNotPaused` modifier, to have absolute control on state changes within the contract in a paused state

```diff
- function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares)
+ function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares)
```
```diff
- function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares)
+ function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares)
```
