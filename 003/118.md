# No Enforcement of Pause Functionality in SuperPool contract

## Summary
No Enforcement of Pause Functionality in `SuperPool` contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
tThe pause functionality is not enforced in `SuperPool` contract. The contract includes a function `togglePause()` that allows the owner to toggle the paused state of the contract. Due to this, users are still able to perform actions such as depositing or minting even when the contract is paused. 

## Impact
users are still able to perform actions such as depositing or minting even when the contract is paused.
