# Pause mechanisms can be bypassed to carry out withdrawals in the pool contract

## Summary
Lenders can escape the pause mechanism and carry out `withdraw` actions from `pool.sol`
## Vulnerability Detail
Individual owners can put their pools on pause. This pause only takes effect on the `deposit` and does not take any effect on `withdrawal`
## Impact
The state of the pools can be adjusted in a paused state

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put a check on the state of the pool as it is checked against in the deposit logic
```diff
    function withdraw(
        uint256 poolId,
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];

        // update state to accrue interest since the last time accrue() was called
        accrue(pool, poolId);

        shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Up);
        // check for rounding error since convertToShares rounds down
        if (shares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroShareRedeem(poolId, assets);
+       if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);

        if (msg.sender != owner && !isOperator[owner][msg.sender]) {
            uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender][poolId];
            if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[owner][msg.sender][poolId] = allowed - shares;
        }

        uint256 maxWithdrawAssets = pool.totalDepositAssets - pool.totalBorrowAssets;
        uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(pool.asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        maxWithdrawAssets = (totalBalance > maxWithdrawAssets) ? maxWithdrawAssets : totalBalance;

        if (maxWithdrawAssets < assets) revert Pool_InsufficientWithdrawLiquidity(poolId, maxWithdrawAssets, assets);

        pool.totalDepositAssets -= assets;
        pool.totalDepositShares -= shares;

        _burn(owner, poolId, shares);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);

        IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
    }
