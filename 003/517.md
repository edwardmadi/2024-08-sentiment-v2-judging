# SuperPool::togglePause is not pausing or unpausing the contract's state

## Summary
`SuperPool` contract has a function `togglePause` which should allow the Owner to pause the contract state when something malicious happens and Unpause them Whenever intended. But in the current case of the contract, Not even a single function can be paused or have the effects of pausing and Unpausing.  
## Vulnerability Detail
`SuperPool` contract functions cannot be paused even though Owner tries to pause the contract by calling `togglePause` Because None of the functions of `SuperPool`implements `whenNotPaused` modifier  which is responsible of checking whether the contract is paused or not. 
As the `whenNotPaused` modifier is not implemented in any of the functions of `SuperPool`  the contract's state/functions cannot be paused/unpaused and the function `togglePause` will have no impact on contract's state/functions. 
Because of Which `SuperPool` contract's state Cannot be Paused with the function `togglePause` which should be its functionality as mentioned in the [comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L163) of `togglePause` function.
## Impact
`SuperPool` contract's state or functions cannot be paused in any necessary situations.
