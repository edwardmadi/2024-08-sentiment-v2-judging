# [H-3]: Toggle Pause does not take effect

## Summary
 Missing whenNotPaused Modifier on Critical Functions in SuperPool
## Vulnerability Detail
The `SuperPool` contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's `Pausable` contract, which provides the `whenNotPaused` modifier to allow the contract's owner to pause the contract during emergency situations. However, key functions such as deposit and withdraw do not implement this modifier. This omission means that these critical functions remain executable even when the contract is paused, defeating the purpose of the `Pausable` functionality and potentially exposing the protocol to risks during emergency conditions.
## Impact
The lack of the `whenNotPaused` modifier on critical functions undermines the ability of the protocol to effectively manage risk in emergency situations. Specifically:

**Operational Risk:** During periods of high volatility, bugs, or security threats, the protocol may intend to pause user interactions to protect assets and maintain stability. If deposit and withdraw functions are not paused, users may continue to interact with the contract in ways that could exacerbate existing issues or expose the protocol to further risks.

**Security Risk:** If a vulnerability is discovered that impacts deposits or withdrawals, the protocol would be unable to quickly halt these operations, potentially leading to significant financial losses.
## Proof Of Concept
```javascript

@> function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

    /// @notice Mints shares into the SuperPool
    /// @param shares The amount of shares to mint
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the shares
    /// @return assets The amount of assets deposited
 @>   function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 assets) {
        accrue();
        assets = _convertToAssets(shares, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Up);
        if (assets == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroAssetMint(address(this), shares);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

    /// @notice Withdraws assets from the SuperPool
    /// @param assets The amount of assets to withdraw
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the assets
    /// @param owner The address to withdraw the assets from
    /// @return shares The amount of shares burned
 @>   function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Up);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareWithdraw(address(this), assets);
        _withdraw(receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    }

    /// @notice Redeems shares from the SuperPool
    /// @param shares The amount of shares to redeem
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the assets
    /// @param owner The address to redeem the shares from
    /// @return assets The amount of assets redeemed
 @>   function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 assets) {
        accrue();
        assets = _convertToAssets(shares, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (assets == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroAssetRedeem(address(this), shares);
        _withdraw(receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure that the `Pausable` functionality is used effectively, the `whenNotPaused` modifier should be added to all critical functions in the SuperPool contract, including `deposit`, `withdraw`, and any other functions that impact user funds or the protocol's operations:

 ```diff
- function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
+ function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant WhenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }
 /// @notice Mints shares into the SuperPool
    /// @param shares The amount of shares to mint
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the shares
    /// @return assets The amount of assets deposited
-   function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 assets) {
+  function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public nonReentrant WhenNotPaused returns (uint256 assets) {
        accrue();
        assets = _convertToAssets(shares, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Up);
        if (assets == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroAssetMint(address(this), shares);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

    /// @notice Withdraws assets from the SuperPool
    /// @param assets The amount of assets to withdraw
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the assets
    /// @param owner The address to withdraw the assets from
    /// @return shares The amount of shares burned
-   function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
+ function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant WhenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
   
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Up);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareWithdraw(address(this), assets);
        _withdraw(receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    }
    /// @notice Redeems shares from the SuperPool
    /// @param shares The amount of shares to redeem
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the assets
    /// @param owner The address to redeem the shares from
    /// @return assets The amount of assets redeemed
-  function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 assets) {
+ function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant WhenNotPaused returns (uint256 assets) {
        accrue();
        assets = _convertToAssets(shares, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (assets == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroAssetRedeem(address(this), shares);
        _withdraw(receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    }
```
By implementing this change, the protocol can better manage risk during emergencies, ensuring that critical operations can be paused when necessary to protect both users and the platform.
