# Super pools can't be paused, in case of an emergency

## Summary

Super pools functions can't be paused, in case of an emergency

## Vulnerability Detail

As can be seen in `SuperPool.sol`, there is a pausing/unpausing function implemented, with the idea to freeze the functionality:

```javascript
/// @notice Toggle pause state of the SuperPool
    function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```

The problem is that this logic is inefficient. Based on OZ's `Pausable.sol` code a `whenNotPaused` modifier is required in order to freeze the functions successfully when the pool is in paused state: 

```javascript

OZ::Pausable.sol:

 modifier whenNotPaused() {
        _requireNotPaused();
        _;
    }


function _requireNotPaused() internal view virtual {
        if (paused()) {
            revert EnforcedPause();
        }
    }
```

For example the correct logic is implemented in the `PositionManager` contract, but lacks in the super pool: 

```javascript
                                                                                 !!!!!!!!!!!!!
function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```

## Impact

- Impact: High, in case of an emergency the admin can't freeze the protocol. The worst outcome would be funds to be stolen
- Likelihood: Low, as it requires a breach in the protocol's code to happen
- Overall: Medium
