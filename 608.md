# [M-5] Inability to Transfer Out Delisted Assets from PositionAsset Array

## Description:
In the protocol, when an asset is delisted, positions that hold this asset in their `PositionAsset` array are unable to transfer the asset out. This creates a situation where users with delisted assets are effectively trapped, unable to manage or liquidate their positions. The inability to transfer out these assets may lead to various operational and financial issues for users, particularly if the asset's value declines or if the user wishes to rebalance their portfolio.

## Impact:
The inability to transfer delisted assets introduces several significant risks:

User Funds Locked: Users with delisted assets are unable to transfer or sell them, effectively locking their funds. This can lead to significant financial loss if the value of the delisted asset declines or if the user is unable to manage their position effectively.

Operational Inefficiency: The inability to remove delisted assets from a position may prevent users from optimizing their portfolios or fulfilling other financial strategies, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

## Proof of Concept:
Consider the following scenario:

A user holds a delisted asset in their PositionAsset array. The protocol does not allow the transfer of this asset out of the position, effectively locking the user‚Äôs funds and preventing any further management of their position.
The relevant portion of the code might look something like this:

}
```
the Test fails which means user asset can't be transfered if it has been delisted by the protocol
## Recommended Mitigation:
To resolve this issue, consider implementing the following changes:

Allow Transfers of Delisted Assets: Modify the transfer logic to permit the transfer of delisted assets out of the PositionAsset array. This will allow users to manage their positions and remove delisted assets as needed.
**Alternative Mechanisms:** If transferring delisted assets is not an option, consider implementing an alternative mechanism, such as allowing users to sell or liquidate the asset within the protocol, or providing a redemption process for delisted assets.
