# Malicious liquidator will be able to liquidate healthy position via `liquidateBadDebt` in an edge case

## Summary
Due to a missing check in `riskModule.validateBadDebt()` , a malicious liquidator will be able to liquidate a healthy position.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `PositionManager.sol` the function `liquidateBadDebt` is used to liquidate the bad debt position in the protocol, and it is calling ` riskEngine.validateBadDebt` to validate if the position is a badDebt position or not, now the this funciton is internally calling `riskModule.validateBadDebt()` to validate the bad debt, now if we see the logic of the function in the riskModule contract :

```solidity
 function validateBadDebt(address position) external view {
        uint256 totalDebtValue = getTotalDebtValue(position);
        uint256 totalAssetValue = getTotalAssetValue(position);
        if (totalAssetValue > totalDebtValue) revert RiskModule_NoBadDebt(position);
    }
```

The above function has a if condition which is checking if `totalAssetValue > totalDebtValue` and reverts , which means if the assets in the vault is more than the debt in the vault it will just revert because there is no bad debt incurred yet , however it is not taking into account the condition when `totalAssetValue = totalDebtValue` which is when the assets in the vault are exactly equal to the debt in the vault which also means that there is still no bad debt in the vault and the position shouldn't be liquidated , but since this check will pass when both are equal and the liquidation will proceed and the position will get liquidated in that case causing an unfair liquidation.
## Impact
Malicious liquidator will be able to liquidate a healthy position.

## Recommendation

```diff
- if (totalAssetValue > totalDebtValue) revert RiskModule_NoBadDebt(position);
+ if (totalAssetValue >= totalDebtValue) revert RiskModule_NoBadDebt(position);
