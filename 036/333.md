# SuperPool Owners Can Set the `assetCap` Without Restriction, Leading to Underutilization

### Summary

The SuperPool owner can set the `assetCap` of a Pool to a much higher `poolCap` set by the Pool Owner. This results in underutilized liquidity, which in turn could lead to missed profit opportunities for lenders.

### Root Cause

In [Superpool.sol:317](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L317), the `addPool` function, the `assetCap` of a Pool within a SuperPool can be set independently by the SuperPool owner, without regard to the `poolCap` set by the Owner. When the assetCap is set higher than the poolCap, deposits exceeding the poolCap are not reverted, but instead, the excess funds remain within the SuperPool itself. This situation leads to underutilization of the poolâ€™s available liquidity, which should have otherwise been utilized to maximize returns for lenders.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. SuperPool owner needs to set the assetCap of the pool higher than the poolCap set by the Pool Owner

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Pool Owner sets the poolCap of Pool A to 10 ether.
2. Using addPool, SuperPool Owner adds Pool A to SuperPool A with an assetCap of 20 ether.
3. User A deposits 5 ether through SuperPool A. This deposit is allocated to Pool A, bringing Pool A's balance to 5 ether.
4. User B deposits 10 ether through SuperPool A. Instead of reverting when Pool A's capacity is reached, the entire 10 ether deposit remains within the SuperPool and is not distributed to Pool A, even though Pool A still has a 5 ether capacity remaining.

### Impact

Missed profit opportunities for lenders. This is occurs because the excess funds, instead of being allocated to a Pool where they could generate interest, remain idle in the SuperPool.

### PoC

Copy below codes to `Superpool.t.sol` and run `forge test --match-test testUnutilizedPools`


```solidity 
    function testUnutilizedPools() public {
    address superPoolOwnerA = makeAddr("superPoolOwnerA");
    address userA = makeAddr("userA");
    address userB = makeAddr("userB");

    // Pool Wwner sets the poolCap
    vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
    pool.setPoolCap(linearRatePool, 10 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Deploy SuperPool A 
    vm.prank(superPoolOwnerA);
    asset1.mint(address(this), initialDepositAmt);
    asset1.approve(address(superPoolFactory), initialDepositAmt);
    address deployedA = superPoolFactory.deploySuperPool(
    superPoolOwnerA, address(asset1), makeAddr("feeRecipient"), 0, type(uint256).max, initialDepositAmt, "test", "test"
    );

    // Set superPoolCap for SuperPool A
    SuperPool superPoolA = SuperPool(deployedA);
    vm.prank(superPoolOwnerA);
    superPoolA.setSuperpoolCap(100 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // SuperPool Owner adds the pool to the SuperPool A and set the assetCap
    vm.startPrank(superPoolOwnerA);
    superPoolA.addPool(linearRatePool, 20 ether); 
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // User A deposits to the SuperPool
    vm.startPrank(userA);
    asset1.mint(userA, 5 ether);
    asset1.approve(address(superPoolA), 5 ether);
    superPoolA.deposit(5 ether, userA); 
    vm.stopPrank();

    // User B deposits to the SuperPool
    uint256 userBDepositAmount = 10 ether;
    vm.startPrank(userB);
    asset1.mint(userB, userBDepositAmount);
    asset1.approve(address(superPoolA), userBDepositAmount);
    superPoolA.deposit(userBDepositAmount, userB);

    // All 10 ether deposits by UserB will go to the SuperPool even though Pool A still has a 5 ether capacity remaining.
    uint256 unutilizedAmount = (superPoolA.totalAssets() - initialDepositAmt) - pool.getTotalAssets(linearRatePool);
    assertEq(unutilizedAmount, userBDepositAmount, "There should be 10 ether unutilized in the SuperPool");
}
```



### Mitigation

Ensure that the `assetCap` set by a SuperPool owner does not exceed the `poolCap` of the underlying pool to prevent excess funds from remaining unused in the SuperPool.
