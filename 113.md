# Missing pause check in `withdraw` & `repay` function


## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw` and `repay` functions in the `pool.sol` contract are missing the necessary pause check, which means it will be possible to withdraw and repay even when the pool is paused.

```solidity
        if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);
```

## Impact
`withdraw` and `repay` function can be called when the pool is paused.
