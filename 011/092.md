# A malicious actor can frontrun initializePool to create an invalid pool

## Summary
Malicious actor can frontrun `initializePool`  and set `poolCap` to `0`

This prevents anyone from being able to deposit to the pool

## Vulnerability Detail
The `poolId` is calculated as `uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, asset, rateModelKey)));`

A malicious actor can frontrun `initializePool` and create a pool with the same `owner`, `asset` and `rateModelKey`

However they can set a different value for `poolCap` , so they can set `poolCap = 0` making the pool unusable since depositing any amount would revert.

## Impact
The actual pool creation transaction will fail, and the pool will not be depositable until the owner manually resets the pool cap.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Considering using msg.sender rather than owner when calculating poolId, as this would prevent the frontrunning attack.
