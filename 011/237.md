# A Malicious User Can Temporarily DoS Deposits into a Newly Created Sentiment Pool

## Summary
A malicious user could temporarily block deposits to a newly created base pool, by front-running the pool creation.
## Vulnerability Detail

Assuming userA wants to create a new sentiment pool, while userB intends to deposit to userA's pool afterwards.

A malicious userC can temporarily block userB's deposits by frontrunning userA's [Pool:initializePool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L562-L598) function call, with the same owner, asset and rateModelKey parameters, but with a zero(0) poolCap. Since the pool id is based on the owner, asset and rateModelKey parameters, the pool will be created and the pool owner initialized to the input userA address.
On subsequent deposit trials from userB, all deposit attempts to the pool will fail, due to the pool cap being zero:

```solidity
        if (pool.totalDepositAssets + assets > pool.poolCap)
            revert Pool_PoolCapExceeded(poolId);
```



## Impact
Deposit into a newly created pool can be temporarily DoSed.

## Recommendation
On [Pool:initializePool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L562-L598) function call, require the caller to be the owner, or simply use the caller as the owner.
