The use of block.timestamp in time-based logic could be exploited by miners who have some control over the blockâ€™s timestamp. They might manipulate the timestamp to either accelerate or delay the  updatePrice and manipulate price.



### Root Cause

Using unsafe block.timestamp parameter



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Miners can manipulate the timestamp to either accelerate or delay the timelock mechanism, which could allow price manipulation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a more secure time oracle or limit the range of acceptable timestamps to reduce the effectiveness of timestamp manipulation.
Introduce a buffer period to ensure that block.timestamp manipulations cannot be used to bypass time-based restrictions.
