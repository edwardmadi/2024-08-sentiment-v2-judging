# Time-Based Logic Vulnerabilities at  at _getPriceWithSanityChecks function for ChainlinkEthOracle contract

### Summary

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkEthOracle.sol#L103

The use of block.timestamp in time-based logic could be exploited by miners who have some control over the blockâ€™s timestamp. They might manipulate the timestamp to either accelerate or delay the timelock mechanism, which could allow manipulation of price

### Root Cause

Using unsafe block.timestamp parameter

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Miners can manipulate the timestamp to either accelerate or delay the timelock mechanism, which could allow to manipulate price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a more secure time oracle or limit the range of acceptable timestamps to reduce the effectiveness of timestamp manipulation.
Introduce a buffer period to ensure that block.timestamp manipulations cannot be used to bypass time-based restrictions.
