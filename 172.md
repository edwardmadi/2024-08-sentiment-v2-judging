# `OwnableUpgradeable` uses single-step ownership transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner of a contract in the Sentiment V2 ecosystem can be changed through a call to the `transferOwnership` function. This function internally calls the `_transferOwnership` function, which immediately sets the contractâ€™s new owner. Making such a critical change in a single step is error-prone and can lead to irrevocable mistakes.

## Impact
Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in OwnableUpgradeable.sol where a single-step transfer is implemented.This can be a problem for all methods marked in onlyOwner throughout the protocol, some of which are core protocol functionality.
