# Protocol cannot be deployed on Linea due to PUSH0 not supported

### Summary

Deployment on Linea may result in unexpected behaviour of failure due to `PUSH0` opcode not supported.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/25a0c8aeaddec273c5318540059165696591ecfb/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L2

The current codebase is compiled with Solidity `^0.8.24` which includes the `PUSH0` opcode in the compiled bytecode.

Currently, the Linea chain, doesn't support `PUSH0` as we can see from the [documentation](https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes).

### Impact

Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity version (0.8.24) may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported `PUSH0` opcode.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using Solidity `0.8.19` to compile for Linea because it doesn't use `PUSH0`.
