# The PUSH0 opcode is not supported on all EVM-compatable networks, causing deployment reverts

## Summary

The contest [readme](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/349) mentions that the codebase should be able to be deployed to any EVM network. With the current codebase, some deployments will revert due to Solidity version 0.8.24 generating the PUSH0 opcode.

> "On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed? Any EVM-compatbile network"


## Vulnerability Detail

Not all EVM-compatable networks support all opcodes. ZkSync, Linea, and Polygon ZkEvm do not currently support the PUSH0 opcode resulting in reverts upon deployment.

## Impact

Deployment will revert

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Before depploying the codebase to a network, check opcode compatability. When PUSH0 is not supported, compile the code using an earlier version where PUSH0 opcodes are not generated.
