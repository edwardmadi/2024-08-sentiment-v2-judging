# Actions on a position will fail if a position is not healthy and the performed action doesn't bring it back to a healthy state

### Summary
The invariant isPositionHealthy() is called after all actions performed on a Position will result in the inability to perform certain actions when a Position is deemed unhealthy.





### Root Cause
PositionManager.sol is a periphery contract for managing Position beacons. After performing any operation on a Position, an invariant isPositionHealthy is called in PositionManager.sol:231 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L231 to check position health and revert if the performed actions results in an unhealthy state.   

However this also means that if a position is currently unhealthy, users won't be able to perform any action unless the action brings the position back to a healthy state.  

Example:  
1)Position becomes unhealthy due to market conditions
2)User wants to repay a small amount
3)Repay fails because it didn't bring the Position back to health

### Attack Path

Example:  
1)Position becomes unhealthy due to market conditions
2)User wants to repay a small amount
3)Repay fails because it didn't bring the Position back to health

### Impact

When a position is unhealthy, only action that can be done is bringing the Position back to a healthy state either by repaying or depositing more collateral. Any other actions will fail the invariant check. Repaying and Deposit will also fail if it doesn't bring Position back to healthy state.  
Another example would be the inability to swap a collateral which is declining in value for a better performing asset. This would be helpful in combating the value decline of collateral however it is not possible in this scenario.  

This would break important contract functionality and may lead to funds lost by users.
