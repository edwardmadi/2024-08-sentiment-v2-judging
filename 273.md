# Malicious users can disallow regular users from withdrawing

## Summary
Malicious users can disallow regular users from withdrawing
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon withdrawing, we calculate the amount available to withdraw like this:
```solidity
uint256 maxWithdrawAssets = pool.totalDepositAssets - pool.totalBorrowAssets;
```
Malicious users can easily disallow other users from withdrawing like this:
1. User tries to withdraw 1 ETH
2. Maximum amount available to withdraw is 1 ETH so this should pass but a malicious user frontruns the user and borrows
3. User's transaction fails as there is not enough funds to withdraw
4. Malicious user repays the borrowed amount
## Impact
Malicious users can disallow regular users from withdrawing
