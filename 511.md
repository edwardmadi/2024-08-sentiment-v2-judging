# Owner doesn't pay anything while liquidating bad debt

### Summary

When owner liquidates bad debt it takes the borrowers collateral and writes off it's debt from the Pool. In case of a large debt it'll lead to the value of shares of that Pool to decrease drastically. All the users withdrawing their assets after will get peanuts. So, the frontrunners will try to protect themselves and withdraw before owner's `liquidateBadDebt()` call. Rest all the users will be impacted.

### Root Cause

All the liquidity provides taken the burn of bad debt while owner takes the 100% of collateral amount too.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Alice deposits 1000 USDC in the Pool.
2. Owner liquidated a bad debt.
3. Alice withdraws and get only 10 USDC as the liquidated debt was a huge debt.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Lead to the sharp decrease in asset per share price. All the users withdrawing afterwards from the Pool will get less assets that they deposited.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There should be a process to convert the collateral to asset as we have the oracle providing the price feed for both the tokens. So that the converted amount can be sent back to the Pool to avoid drastic price changes of asset/share.
