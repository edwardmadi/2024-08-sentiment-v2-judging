# `Superpool` contract doesn't strictly follow EIP4626

## Summary
`Superpool` contract doesn't strictly follow EIP4626
## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in the contest README, the `Superpool` contract must strictly follow EIP4626. Here is what we can see about the implementation of `maxDeposit` for the EIP4626 standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626):
>MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if deposits are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

We can see that user-specific limits must be factored in. However, let's imagine that the user tries to deposit USDC into the pool (token that will be allowed for usage as mentioned in the contest README). If the user is blacklisted for it, he will not be able to deposit. That is a user-specific limit so the function should return 0 in that case. However, it does not, thus it does not follow the standard strictly.
