# Liquidations on borrowed pool shares may cause bad debt

## Summary
When borrowing pool shares, liquidators may not have access to enough shares to repay the debt, leading to bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
The system allows pools to use shares as their assets, meaning users can use these shares as collateral and as borrowed assets. However, if shares are used as borrowed assets, the system could accrue bad debt. This is because liquidation needs to happen promptly to avoid bad debt, but this may not be possible when the borrowed assets are pool shares. These shares might have limited liquidity, or the pool might have reached its cap.

Example:
1. Alice has 100 A tokens as collateral and has borrowed 80 shares of a pool that uses B as an asset.
2. Alice's A tokens lose value, and she needs to be liquidated.
3. The liquidator needs to deposit in pool B, get its shares, and repay Alice's debt.
4. However, pool B has reached its cap and isn't accepting more deposits.

In this scenario, Alice's position would cause bad debt to pool B because liquidators can't obtain enough assets to repay the debt and liquidate Alice.

## Impact
Using shares as collateral or as borrowed assets is risky and can lead to bad debt.

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanic that bypasses pool caps when called by liquidators (or integrate it into the [liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L430-L444) function), allowing liquidators to acquire the shares needed to repay the debt.
