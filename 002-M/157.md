# `ASSET.approve` will revert for non-standard tokens like `USDT`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
`SuperPool::reallocate` function attempts to reallocate the assets between the underlying pools, as it withdraws first and then deposits again but before `POOL.deposit` it approves the `ASSET` amount using `ASSET.approve` which can revert if `ASSET` is an token like USDT.
Some non-standard tokens like USDT will revert when a contract or a user tries to approve an allowance when the spender allowance has already been set to a non zero value.
## Impact
Users won't be able to reallocate their assets between underlying pools, as `ASSET.approve` will revert if allowance is not zero already.
## Code Snippet

## Proof of Concept
USDT approve method (it checks that allowance is zero):
```javascript
function approve(
    address _spender,
    uint _value
    ) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
...
    require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));
    allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
...
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeERC20's forceApprove method instead to support all the ERC20 tokens.
