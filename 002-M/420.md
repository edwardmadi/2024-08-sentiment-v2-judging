# Protocol functions is incompatible with USDT due to lack of 0 approval

## Summary
Protocol functions is incompatible with USDT due to lack of 0 approval

## Vulnerability Detail
As per contest readme, SentimentV2 will be deployed on `Any EVM-compatbile network` and USDT/USDC tokens are also expected to be used by protocol. The issue is with below instances which is for USDT token on Ethereum mainnet. The asset for superPool can also be USDT and likes tokens.

In `SuperPool.reallocate()`:

```solidity
    function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
        if (!isAllocator[msg.sender] && msg.sender != Ownable.owner()) {
            revert SuperPool_OnlyAllocatorOrOwner(address(this), msg.sender);
        }

       . . . some code . . . 
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
@>              ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
    }
```
and in `SuperPoolFactory.deploySuperPool()` function:

```solidity
    function deploySuperPool(
        address owner,
        address asset,
        address feeRecipient,
        uint256 fee,
        uint256 superPoolCap,
        uint256 initialDepositAmt,
        string calldata name,
        string calldata symbol
    ) external returns (address) {

       . . . some code . . .
       
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), initialDepositAmt); // assume approval
@>        IERC20(asset).approve(address(superPool), initialDepositAmt);
        uint256 shares = superPool.deposit(initialDepositAmt, address(this));
        
       . . . some code . . .
       
    }
```

The issue is that, tokens like USDT do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)â€™s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals. [Link to usdt contract reference(SLOC 199-209)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)

USDT approve() is implemented as:

```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {

        // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
        //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
        //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
        //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
        require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
    }
```

Therefore, an approval to 0 is required in case of USDT tokens.

It should be noted that, `SuperPool.sol` has used `forceApprove()` for approving `ASSET` to `Pool address` which mitigates this issue completely and this can be checked [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L533) therefore, `forceApprove()` should be used at impacted functions.

## Impact
approve function can fail for non standard ERC20 tokens like USDT. USDT would be incompatible with above functions flow and would be impossible to use as intended by protocol.

## Recommendation
Use openzeppelin's `forceApprove()` to mitigate this issue.
