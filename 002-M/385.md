# Approve function not supported for USDT on some networks, resulting in inability to deploy a SuperPool with USDT as the asset

## Summary

USDT not supported due to having no return value on mainnet. This will cause EVM reverts due to solidity's return data length check.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contest [readme](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/349) indicates that the intention is to deploy the protocol on any EVM-compatible network:

>"Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed? A: Any EVM-compatbile network"

In addition, it is expected that USDT is supported:

>"Protocol governance will ensure that oracles are only set for standard ERC-20 tokens (plus USDC/USDT)"

The issue occurs in [`SuperPoolFactory::deploySuperPool()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPoolFactory.sol#L73), and in [`SuperPool::reallocate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L450
) which both attempt to call `approve()` on the `asset`.


## Impact

- SuperPool cannot be deployed with USDT as the asset on mainnet due to reverts when trying to approve the initial deposit in `SuperPoolFactory::deploySuperPool()`
- Even if a SuperPool was deployed with USDT as the asset without using the factory, any call to `SuperPool::reallocate()` would also revert

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `forceApprove()` instead to ensure compatability
