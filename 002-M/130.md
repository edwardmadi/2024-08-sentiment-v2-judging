# DOS on reallocate function in SuperPool

## Summary
`SuperPool.reallocate` function calls `approve` on `ASSET` that do not handle non-standard erc20 behavior. USDT may be a classic non-standard erc20 token.

## Vulnerability Detail
For tokens like `USDT`, the transaction reverts on calling of `approve` when the allowance is not zero. 

Here's a short POC.
```solidity
usdt.functions.approve(basket.address, 100).transact()
## the second tx would be reverted as the allowance is not zero
usdt.functions.approve(basket.address, 50).transact()
```
The function `SuperPool._supplyToPools` uses `ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);` but the `supplyAmt` passed is not guaranteed to be consumed by `Pool` contract and hence there may be non-zero allowance to `Pool` contract which will cause `SuperPool.reallocate` function to revert. Let's check on when the `Pool` contract doesn't consume `supplyAmt` provided below:
The `pool capacity` for `poolId` in `Pool` contract is different from `SuperPool's poolCapFor[poolId]`. `supplyAmt` is determined based on `SuperPool's` cap and it doesn't check the `poolId's cap in Pool` contract. Due to this, `POOL.deposit` may revert which will cause `SuperPool` contract to have non-zero allowance(i.e. `supplyAmt`). 
```solidity
 if (assetsInPoolIncludingInterestEarned < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPoolIncludingInterestEarned;
                if (amountToDeposit < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = amountToDeposit;
                ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

                // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
                try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                    amountToDeposit -= supplyAmt;
                } catch { }

                if (amountToDeposit == 0) return;
            }
        }
```

## Impact
`reallocate` function will revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the `ASSET.forceApprove` in `reallocate` function.
