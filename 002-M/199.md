# SuperPool's `Reallocate` Function Is Broken for USDT Pools

## Summary
- The `reallocate` function in `SuperPool` contract  is incompatible with `USDT` on Ethereum mainnet due to a mismatch in the approve function implementation. This renders the reallocation feature unusable for `USDT` pools, 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the reallocate function of SuperPool.sol, the following line is used to approve asset transfers:
```js
ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
```

- This call assumes that all ERC20 tokens, including `USDT`, implement the standard approve function that returns a boolean. However, `USDT` on Ethereum mainnet does not conform to this standard - its approve function does not return a boolean value.

- The discrepancy causes transactions involving `USDT` approval to revert, 
- According to the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-if-you-are-integrating-tokens-are-you-allowing-only-whitelisted-tokens-to-work-with-the-codebase-or-any-complying-with-the-standard-are-they-assumed-to-have-certain-properties-eg-be-non-reentrant-are-there-any-types-of-weird-tokens-you-want-to-integrate), `USDT` is a supported asset, and the protocol will be deployed on Ethereum mainnet. This mismatch between the implementation and USDT's behavior on mainnet will prevent the reallocate function from working with `USDT` pools.
## Impact
- The `reallocate` feature becomes unusable for USDT pools on mainnet, preventing efficient capital allocation for a major supported stablecoin.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use the forceApprove function from OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library instead of the standard approve
```diff

function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
        // ... existing code ...

        for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
            if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
-               ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
+               ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
    }
