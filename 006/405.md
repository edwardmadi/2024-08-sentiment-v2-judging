# Faulty Fee Validation in SuperPool Contract

## Summary
The constructor of the `SuperPool` contract contains a mistake where the `fee` member variable is improperly compared instead of using the `fee_` parameter. This can lead to incorrect validation of the initial fee configuration during contract deployment.

## Vulnerability Detail
The constructor includes an incorrect validation check that compares the member variable `fee`—which is uninitialized at the point of comparison—against the maximum acceptable fee (`1e18`). Instead, the constructor should compare the `fee_` parameter being passed during deployment.

## Impact
This incorrect comparison can result in the deployment of the contract with an invalid fee setting. Such a bug makes it possible for the contract to be deployed with an excessively high fee rate or other unintended conditions, severely impacting the fee mechanism's functionality and overall contract security.

## Code Snippet
[Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L157)
```solidity
constructor(
...
) Ownable() ERC20(name_, symbol_) {
...
@>    if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
    fee = fee_;
    feeRecipient = feeRecipient_;
    superPoolCap = superPoolCap_;
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
To correct this issue, update the constructor to validate the `fee_` parameter against `1e18` during the contract deployment phase. This ensures that the fee-related validations are accurate, preventing logical errors. Here is the corrected version of the constructor:

```diff
constructor(
...
) Ownable() ERC20(name_, symbol_) {
...
-    if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
+    if (fee_ > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
    fee = fee_;
    feeRecipient = feeRecipient_;
    superPoolCap = superPoolCap_;
}
```
