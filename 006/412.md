# Superpool owners can carry out excessive fee setting exploit

## Summary
The fees to be charged by superpool, from the architecture of the system is controlled to have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 1e18. However the check in the constructor does not correctly do an input validation of the `fee_` variable, insted it incorrectly  checks if the state variable `fee` is set below 1e18. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Superpool owners can set fees as high as they want permanently. The check on #L158 is incorrectly done. On deployment the check will always pass beacuse `fee` is set to 0 initially which will always be less than 1e18.

## Impact
Lenders will be charged unfairly against the set rule of the protocol
