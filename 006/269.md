# Critical Constructor Misconfiguration Allowing Incorrect Fee Assignments


## Reference
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L157
## Summary
The constructor in the `SuperPool` contract contains a logic flaw where the `fee` assignment does not compare the correct input parameter. This issue can lead to the initialization of an incorrect fee value, causing potential mismanagement of protocol funds, improper fee distribution, and operational instability.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue in the constructor of the `SuperPool` contract lies in how it handles the assignment of the fee. Specifically, the code uses an uninitialized variable `fee` in the comparison check, instead of the intended `fee_` input parameter:

```solidity
if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
fee = fee_;
```
This oversight leads to the comparison being ineffective, allowing any value for `fee_` to be accepted and subsequently assigned. Since the check is against an uninitialized variable (`fee`), which defaults to zero, this logic fails entirely to enforce the intended upper limit of `1e18`. As a result, the constructor can initialize the contract with an invalid fee, leading to several critical issues.
## Impact
First of all it breaks protocols rules as any type of value can be added to the fee. The contract might operate with fee rates that are out of the acceptable range, causing users to be either overcharged or undercharged, impacting user trust and overall protocol economics. An incorrectly set fee can lead to improper fund distribution, either starving the fee recipient of their share or disproportionately extracting funds from the protocol.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the constructor, ensure that the fee check compares the correct input parameter:

```solidity
if (fee_ > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
fee = fee_;
```
This adjustment guarantees that only valid fee values are accepted during contract deployment.
