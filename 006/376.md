# In the constructor of `SuperPool`, the `fee` is checked against `1e18` but it should be the `fee_` to be checked

## Summary
In the constructor of `SuperPool`, it is supposed to validate the input of `fee_` against `1e18`; however, the code is checking the `fee` which is not the intention.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `fee` is a declared public `uint256` variable so by default it is initialized as `0`, hence, this line of validation does not do anything meaningful. It should actually check the `fee_` which is one of the input params into the constructor.

## Impact
This line of validation is supposed to guard against excessively high fees input, but now it is totally not working. Without this guard, an excessively high fee in effect can lead to severe financial damage to the users, so it ought to be a **HIGH** issue; however, on the other hand, it's the constructor, so by default we trust the owner and take it as a **LOW** likelihood for the human errors by the owner. Therefore, all things considered, this bug should have a fair **MEDIUM** severity.

## Code Snippet
The bug is in this line of code below:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should be changed to:
```solidity
        if (fee_ > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
```
