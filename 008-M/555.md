# Superpool vault fees update leaves room for a permanent exploit by superpool owner

## Summary
The function `superpool.requestFeeUpdate()` perfoms a wrong input validation of the fee variable leaving room for the fee to be permanently set to a value above 1e18 as against the protocol's wish
## Vulnerability Detail
The function attempts to perform a check on the input variable `_fee`  but however wrongly handles the logic and checks for `fee` instead. The `fee` variable as set from the constructor also has an issue that allows this check be bypassed on deployment. Once this fee is set to such value the function `superpool.requestFeeUpdate()` becomes permanently disabled   
## Impact
This fee once set on deployement to such a value higher than 1e18 cannot be reset

```solidity
    function requestFeeUpdate(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner {
        if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
        pendingFeeUpdate = PendingFeeUpdate({ fee: _fee, validAfter: block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_DURATION });
        emit SuperPoolFeeUpdateRequested(_fee);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
- if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
+ if (_fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
