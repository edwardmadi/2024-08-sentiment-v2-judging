High

# Fee Configuration Issue

High

## Summary
The requestFeeUpdate function allows for a fee to be set by the owner, but it only validates if the fee is over 100% (1e18). A malicious owner could set an extremely high fee just under 100%, effectively stealing all earnings from pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker, potentially the contract owner or someone who gains control over the owner's account, sets the fee close to 100%. This would cause all interest earned by the pool to be redirected to the attacker. Users would receive no returns or even lose their principal due to hidden fees.

## Impact
Loss of all interest earnings for users, potentially millions in value depending on the pool size

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a hard cap on fees(e.g., 10%) and add a governance or multisig mechanism to approve fee charges, reducing the risk of a single-point attack
