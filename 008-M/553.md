# [M-3]: Incorrect Fee Validation Logic in requestFeeUpdate Function

## Summary
Vault fees, Once set above the limit cannot be reset due to mistook variable `_fee` and `fee`
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `SuperPool` contract, the `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate` function is intended to propose a new fee for the pool. However, the function contains a logical error that causes it to always revert if the fee was previously set above the threshold of 1e18. Specifically, the function checks the existing fee value instead of validating the _fee argument passed to the `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate` function. This means that once the fee has been set above the threshold, it can never be updated or corrected, effectively locking the pool in an unusable state.

## Impact
This issue has significant implications for the functionality of the protocol:

**Permanent Locking of Fee Updates:** If the fee is ever mistakenly set above the allowed threshold, the pool becomes locked in that state. The owner cannot update or correct the fee, rendering the pool potentially unusable or non-compliant with the intended fee structure.

**Operational Risk:** The inability to update the fee in response to market conditions or governance decisions could lead to operational inefficiencies and limit the protocolâ€™s flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Proof of Concept:
The problematic logic is found in the  `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate` unction:

solidity
Copy code
```javascript
function requestFeeUpdate(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner {
@>    if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();  // Incorrectly checks the current fee, not the new proposed fee
    pendingFeeUpdate = PendingFeeUpdate({ fee: _fee, validAfter: block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_DURATION });
    emit SuperPoolFeeUpdateRequested(_fee);
}
```
In this implementation, the function always checks the current fee value rather than the _fee argument provided by the owner. As a result, if the current fee is already above 1e18, the function will revert, making it impossible to propose a new fee, even if it is within the allowed threshold.

Recommended Mitigation:
To fix this issue, the `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate`  function should validate the _fee argument rather than the existing fee value. This ensures that the proposed fee is checked against the threshold before being set, allowing for updates even if the current fee is invalid:

```diff
function requestFeeUpdate(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner {
-    if (_fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();  // Correctly checks the new proposed fee
+   if (_fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();  // Correctly checks the new proposed fee

    pendingFeeUpdate = PendingFeeUpdate({ fee: _fee, validAfter: block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_DURATION });
    emit SuperPoolFeeUpdateRequested(_fee);
}
```
