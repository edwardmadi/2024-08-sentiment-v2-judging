# Superpool's fee sanitization is done incorrectly

### Summary
The fee sanitization value is done on the storage value of `fee` instead of it's input from the function, therefore the protocol does not catch admin's mistake in case they set a higher fee than the threshold and can start taking away depositors' assets.

### Root Cause
This is probably a silly mistake, and since it is an admin action it won't happen if admin is careful when setting the fee value. However, once it is set above the threshold `1e18`, the pool should be abandoned as all further fee updates will be rejected.

[SuperPool.sol#L367](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L367)
```solidity
    if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
```

### Impact
In case admin makes a mistake and sets the fee value above the `1e18` threshold:
- The protocol starts eating away depositors' shares with each accrual, since it is minting more fee shares than the asset accrued through underlying pools.
- Pool needs to be abandoned by the depositors as soon as possible, this might not be possible due to underlying markets' high utilization percentage.
- Fees can not be updated anymore.

However, this is all would be possible _if_ the admin makes a mistake.

### Mitigation
Use the correct input values for sanitization.
