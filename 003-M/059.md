# Incorrect Decimal Calculation in getValueInEth can lead to wrong ETH value conversions, affecting the accuracy of the oracle for ChainlinkUsdOracle

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkUsdOracle.sol#L86

When decimals > 18, the formula used for conversion could lead to unintended results, since 10 ** decimals - 18 is not handled correctly.

### Root Cause

Lack of input validation.

### Internal pre-conditions
