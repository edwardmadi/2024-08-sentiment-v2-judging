# Erroneous calculation in the function `ChainlinkUsdOracle::getValueInEth()`

## Summary
The identified vulnerability lies within the `getValueInEth` function, specifically in the calculation of asset value against ETH value when the asset's decimal exceeds 18 (at Line#86, in the calculated return value for the `else` condition).

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getValueInEth` function is used to convert the value of a specified amount of an asset into its equivalent ETH value based on the current USD price of both the ETH and the asset. However, within the function, the computation carried out when the asset's decimal count is above 18 is erroneous.

The line of code:
```solidity
else return (amt / (10 ** decimals - 18)).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
```
aims to adjust the asset amount (`amt`) by dividing it by `10 ** (decimals - 18)`. But due to an incorrect placement of parenthesis, the operation `(10 ** decimals - 18)` is not equivalent to `(10 ** (decimals - 18))`. `10 ** decimals - 18` subtracts 18 after the exponentiation, leading to much larger values than intended, resulting in incorrect and unexpectedly small result values from the division.

## Impact
This error is obviously a **HIGH** risk issue, because it totally screwed the calculated value in `ETH` nomination, making it a much smaller value than it should be. This will mess up with many other parts of functionalities in the protocol which relies on this pricing information.

## Code Snippet
The bug is in this line of code below:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correct the formula by fixing the parenthesis. It should correctly encapsulate the subtraction within the exponentiation:
```solidity
else return (amt / (10 ** (decimals - 18))).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
```
