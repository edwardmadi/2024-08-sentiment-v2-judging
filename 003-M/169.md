# Codertjay  Incorrect Scaling Will Lead to Asset Valuation Errors for Users in ChainlinkUsdOracle

### Summary


**Description:**

The `getValueInEth` function is designed to compute the equivalent ETH value for a given amount of a particular asset.
The function correctly handles assets with decimals less than or equal to 18, but there is a significant issue when
dealing with assets with more than 18 decimals.

In the code, the scaling factor for assets with decimals greater than 18 is incorrectly implemented
as `10 ** (decimals - 18)`. However, the actual code uses `10 ** decimals - 18`, which results in an incorrect value due
to the incorrect placement of the subtraction operation. This bug will cause incorrect scaling, leading to an inaccurate
calculation of the asset's value in ETH.

**Impact:**

The incorrect scaling factor can lead to substantial miscalculations in the value of assets with more than 18 decimals.
This could result in either an overestimation or underestimation of the asset's value in ETH. The potential for
financial loss is high, as users might receive significantly more or less ETH than expected, depending on the direction
of the error.


### Root Cause


in `ChainlinkUsdOracle.sol` the scaling factor for assets with decimals greater than 18 is incorrectly implemented

```solidity
return (amt / (10 ** decimals - 18)).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
```

### Impact

Bob notices that when assets with more than 18 decimals are converted to ETH, the protocol incorrectly scales the amount, resulting in a larger ETH value than it should. This means that when Alice converts her DAI (which has 18 decimals), the protocol ends up giving her less ETH than she deserves.

### PoC

### Mitigation


The scaling factor should be correctly implemented by ensuring the subtraction operation is inside the exponentiation.
The correct scaling should be 10 ** (decimals - 18). Below is the corrected version of the code:

```solidity
    function getValueInEth(address asset, uint256 amt) external view returns (uint256) {
        _checkSequencerFeed();

        uint256 ethUsdPrice = _getPriceWithSanityChecks(ETH);
        uint256 assetUsdPrice = _getPriceWithSanityChecks(asset);

        uint256 decimals = IERC20Metadata(asset).decimals();

// [ROUND] price is rounded down. this is used for both debt and asset math, no effect
        if (decimals <= 18)
            return (amt * 10 ** (18 - decimals)).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
        else
            - return (amt / (10 ** decimals - 18)).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
            + return (amt / (10 ** (decimals - 18))).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
    }
```
