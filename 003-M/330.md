# Pool borrowers will get huge profit while borrowing assets which has > 18 decimals with chainlink usd oracle

### Summary

There is a mistake when calculating value for asset which has more than 18 decimals in chainlink usd oracle, leading to the final calculated result is much smaller than expected.

### Root Cause

- In `ChainlinkUsdOracle.sol:86` there is a missing parenthesis between `decimals` and `18` in the formula, leading to incorrect scale down.
Formula in the code : (amt / (10 ** decimals - 18)).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
Expected formula: (amt / (10 ** (decimals - 18))).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
Because of the error, final value will be much smaller than expected

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is pool with asset which has more than 18 decimals.
2. Chainlink usd oracle is used to price this asset.


### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Users call borrow() and receive a huge value worth of pool underlying token,  much more than the value of their collaterals. Because of this, users will just walk away and never pay their debts.

### Impact

- Borrowers can drain pool asset and never pay back
- Liquidation and health check will be incorrect

### Mitigation

Consider this change:
```solidity
(amt / (10 ** (decimals - 18))).mulDiv(uint256(assetUsdPrice), uint256(ethUsdPrice));
```
