# `newBorrowAssets` is wrongly rounded down, possibly blocking users from issuing new loans

### Summary

When calculating the debt of a position, shares to assets calculation is being rounded up, this is done in `Pool::getBorrowsOf`. However, when issuing a loan, using `Pool::borrow`, `newBorrowAssets` is calculated as the accumulated debt of the position and is compared to the minimum debt. However, it is rounded down, possibly leading it to revert as < `minDebt`, knowing that the real debt, in this case, would be >= `minDebt`, when calculated using `getBorrowsOf`.

### Root Cause

`newBorrowAssets` is being rounded down in `Pool::borrow` violating how debt is calculated, using `getBorrowsOf`.

### Impact

Users won't be able to issue new loans.

### PoC

1. User initiates a borrow operation.
2. `borrowShares` is calculated for the new loan using:
```solidity
// compute borrow shares equivalant for notional borrow amt
// [ROUND] round up shares minted, to ensure they capture the borrowed amount
borrowShares = _convertToShares(amt, pool.totalBorrowAssets, pool.totalBorrowShares, Math.Rounding.Up);
```
3. The final/accumulated debt for that position is calculated:
```solidity
// check that final debt amount is greater than min debt
uint256 newBorrowAssets = _convertToAssets(
    borrowSharesOf[poolId][position] + borrowShares,
    pool.totalBorrowAssets + amt,
    pool.totalBorrowShares + borrowShares,
    Math.Rounding.Down
);
```
4. `newBorrowAssets` is wrongly rounded down, forcing it to be less than `minDebt`, while in reality, the debt is >= `minDebt`, when calculated using `getBorrowsOf` (where it rounds up).

### Mitigation

Round `newBorrowAssets` up in `Pool::borrow`:
```diff
  uint256 newBorrowAssets = _convertToAssets(
      borrowSharesOf[poolId][position] + borrowShares,
      pool.totalBorrowAssets + amt,
      pool.totalBorrowShares + borrowShares,
-     Math.Rounding.Down
+     Math.Rounding.Up
  );
```
