# Lack of `SuperPool` Cap Check in Accrual and Deposit Functions

## Summary
The current implementation of the `accrue` and `_deposit` functions in the `SuperPool` contract has a potential issue where the `lastTotalAssets` can exceed the `superPoolCap`. This issue arises because `lastTotalAssets` is updated based on deposits without a check to ensure it does not surpass the `superPoolCap`. Additionally, the interest accrued is added to `lastTotalAssets`, potentially causing it to exceed the cap and affect new deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Lack of Cap Check During Accrual:**
   - **Issue:** The `accrue` function updates `lastTotalAssets` based on the simulated accrual of fees and interest, but it does not include a check to ensure that `lastTotalAssets` does not exceed `superPoolCap`.
   - **Potential Impact:** If the accrued interest and deposited assets cause `lastTotalAssets` to exceed `superPoolCap`, this could lead to incorrect state management and the inability to process further deposits correctly.

2. **Inconsistent Cap Enforcement:**
   - **Issue:** The `_deposit` function checks whether the total assets (`lastTotalAssets` + new deposit) exceed the `superPoolCap` before allowing the deposit. However, this check occurs after `lastTotalAssets` has already been updated with accrued interest.
   - **Potential Impact:** If `lastTotalAssets` has already been inflated by accrued interest, the `superPoolCap` check may not prevent the cap from being exceeded if the combined value of interest and new deposits is too high.
## Impact

- **SuperPool Cap Breach:** There is a risk that `lastTotalAssets` may exceed the `superPoolCap`, which could disrupt deposit processing and lead to potential security issues or operational problems.
- **Incorrect Asset Management:** If `lastTotalAssets` surpasses the cap, the integrity of asset management and cap enforcement within the `SuperPool` is compromised, potentially allowing more deposits than intended.

    uint256 feeAssets = interestAccrued.mulDiv(fee, WAD);
    uint256 feeShares = _convertToShares(feeAssets, newTotalAssets - feeAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);

    ASSET.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
    ERC20._mint(receiver, shares);
    _supplyToPools(assets);
    lastTotalAssets += assets; // lastTotalAsset is total asset in super pool
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement Cap Check During Accrual:- Add a check in the `accrue` function to ensure that `lastTotalAssets` does not exceed `superPoolCap` after updating with accrued interest.
