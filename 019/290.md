# The Redstone oracle can report stale prices

## Summary
The `Redstone` oracle can report stale prices
## Vulnerability Detail
The `Redstone` oracle has a hard coded stale price threshold:
```solidity
uint256 public constant STALE_PRICE_THRESHOLD = 3600;
```
The issue with that is that quite a few price feeds have a lower heartbeat than an hour. Especially on the `BSC` network which an EVM-compatible chain which as mentioned in the README, would be used, we can see that there are price feeds with a heartbeat of just a minute (https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/get-started/price-feeds).
## Impact

## Recommendation
Each price feed must have its own heartbeat
