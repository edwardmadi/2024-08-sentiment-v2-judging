# Hardcoded redstone oracle deviation threshold

### Summary

Protocol is using a hardcoded `STALE_PRICE_THRESHOLD` of 1h, assuming all redstone feeds have 1h deviation threshold.

### Root Cause

In `RedstoneCoreOracle.sol:64` a hardcoded [threshold](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/oracle/RedstoneOracle.sol#L64) is used to check if prices are stale. 

```solidity
    uint256 public constant STALE_PRICE_THRESHOLD = 3600; // 1 hour
...
    function getValueInEth(address, uint256 amt) external view returns (uint256) {
        if (priceTimestamp < block.timestamp - STALE_PRICE_THRESHOLD) revert RedstoneCoreOracle_StalePrice(ASSET);

   ...
}
```
2. Different redstone price feeds have different [heartbeats](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/get-started/price-feeds): 
By example for the L1:
- weETH/USD has a heartbeat of 6h
- USDe/USD has a heartbeat of 24h



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Low volatility for both token pairs such that update conditions are not triggered for more than one hour. 

### Attack Path

1. prices are not updated for more than 1h.
2. User calls `RedstoneCoreOracle.getValueInEth`. Because prices were updated for more than one hour in the past, the if condition fails and transaction reverts :
```solidity
    function getValueInEth(address, uint256 amt) external view returns (uint256) {
        if (priceTimestamp < block.timestamp - STALE_PRICE_THRESHOLD) revert RedstoneCoreOracle_StalePrice(ASSET);
    ...
}

```

### Impact

The functions that rely on `RedstoneCoreOracle.getValueInEth` will revert when prices are not updated for more than 1h. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

From my understanding when the price for more than one asset is updated, the prices for all assets from the `dataFeedIds` array will be updated even if the update conditions for second feeds are not met: 
[link 1](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-oracles-monorepo/blob/94ac46f41be52ee9132bede9d13897f5922c800d/packages/evm-connector/contracts/core/RedstoneConsumerBase.sol#L77-L79) 
```txt
If any of the required conditions (e.g. packages with different timestamps or insufficient number of authorised signers) do not match, the function  will revert.
 ...
 @return dataPackagesTimestamp timestamp equal for all data packages
 ```

This means that when the weETH/usd price is requested (due to the deviation threshold), the USDe/USD price will also be updated, even if the deviation threshold has not been exceeded or the heartbeat has not expired.

If this holds true, then configure the `STALE_PRICE_THRESHOLD` to be min(heartbeat feed1, heartbeatfeed2) could solve this problem.
