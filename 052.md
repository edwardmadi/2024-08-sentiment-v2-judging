# No Check on Token Approval at deploySuperPool for SuperPoolFactory contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPoolFactory.sol#L72

There is no explicit check that superPool has the correct allowance to transfer initialDepositAmt from the factory to itself. The approve call assumes that the SuperPool contract will handle the deposit without issues.

### Root Cause

Check the allowance amount before approving.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Failure to deploy contract.

### PoC
