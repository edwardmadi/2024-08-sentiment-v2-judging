# Owners of bad health positions could liquidate themselves

### Summary

Owners of bad health positions could make profits by liquidating themselves, buying their own collateral at a discounted price.

### Root Cause

- In `PositionManager.sol:430`, liquidate function doesn't check if  the liquidator is the owner of the position.
- Because liquidation can happen anytime as long as the health of the position falls below the threshold, the owner of the position will have time advantage compared to liquidation bots, since he is most likely the first one who knows if his position could be liquidated. 

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Position owners call liquidate their own positions

### Impact

Profit for position owners in some cases. Instead of getting punished, they are getting rewarded for not paying their debts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding:
- A check to see if liquidators themselves are the owners of targeted positions
- A cool off period: Positions could not be liquidated in some time period after their last activities. This makes sure that liquidation bots, other than owners, could see these opportunities as well. This will increase fairness for normal liquidators.
