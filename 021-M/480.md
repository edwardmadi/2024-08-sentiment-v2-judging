# `SuperPool` is vulnerable to an inflation attack

## Summary

Malicious users can donate assets without minting shares to the `SuperPool` contract in order to inflate the price of a share and as a result increase the minimum amount of funds that can be deposited and potentially earn a profit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The amount of shares to mint is calculated using the `ERC20.balanceOf()` function which returns the total amount of assets in the contract. This can be manipulated by directly sending assets to the `SuperPool` contract without going through the `deposit` or `mint` functions.

POC

Alice calls `deposit` and deposits 1000 tokens into the system and receives 100 shares (assuming the current ratio is 1:1 which is likely based on the code). The total supply becomes 2100 from 1100 and the total amount of shares is 2100. Then she directly sends 100 more tokens to the contract making total supply 2200 but the total amount of shares stays the same - 2100.

Now if a user wants to deposit into the pool they will need to deposit more than 1 token since 1 token is less than 1 share. 

Also some users might use the `withdraw` function instead of the `redeem` function and as a result will not receive all of their funds as now their shares will be worth more than the assets they have deposited.

## Impact

Increase of the minimum deposit due to `shares==0` check:

```solidity
    /// @notice Deposits assets into the SuperPool
    /// @param assets The amount of assets to deposit
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the shares
    /// @return shares The amount of shares minted
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
 @>     if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

    /// @notice Mints shares into the SuperPool
    /// @param shares The amount of shares to mint
    /// @param receiver The address to receive the shares
    /// @return assets The amount of assets deposited
    function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 assets) {
        accrue();
        assets = _convertToAssets(shares, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Up);
@>      if (assets == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroAssetMint(address(this), shares);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not use `balanceOf` and manually track the amount of funds in the contract.
