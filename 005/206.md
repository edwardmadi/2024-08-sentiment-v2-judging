# `PositionManager::repay` gets paused, when the contract is paused, removing the abilty for borrowers to lower their debt and possibly lead to liquidation

### Summary

The `PositionManager` contract's `repay` function becomes inaccessible when the contract is paused. This could lead to borrowers not having the ability to `repay` their debt if they wanted to. If a position is close to the maximum threshold and then the `PositionManager` gets paused, the accumulation of fees could result in a position being undercollateralized and lead to liquidation.

### Root Cause

In `PositionManager` the `process` function, which handles loan repayments, is subject to the `whenNotPaused` modifier, preventing repayments when the contract is paused.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract owner needs to call togglePause() to set the paused state to true
2. Borrowers need to have existing loans with outstanding debt
3. Interest rate in the Pool contract needs to be greater than 0%

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are necessary for this vulnerability.

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits collateral into their position and borrows assets, creating a healthy position.
2. The protocol owner or administrator pauses the PositionManager contract, likely due to an emergency or for maintenance.
3. While the PositionManager is paused, time passes and interest continues to accrue on the borrowed assets.
4. The user, noticing their increasing debt, attempts to repay part or all of their loan to avoid potential liquidation.
5. The repayment transaction fails because the PositionManager is paused, preventing the user from reducing their debt.
6. More time passes, and more interest accrues, potentially pushing the position closer to or below the liquidation threshold.
7. The PositionManager remains paused, continuing to prevent users from repaying their loans or managing their positions.
8. If the pause lasts long enough, some users' positions may become eligible for liquidation due to the increased debt from accrued interest.
9. When the PositionManager is finally unpaused, users who have crossed the liquidation threshold may immediately face liquidation, despite having tried to repay their loans earlier.
10. This scenario could lead to unnecessary liquidations and losses for users who were willing and attempting to manage their positions responsibly.

### Impact

Here are some of the more severe consequences for borrowers:

1. Increased Liquidation Risk: As debt continues to grow due to accruing interest, positions may become undercollateralized and subject to liquidation.
2. Inability to Manage Risk: Borrowers are prevented from managing their position's risk by reducing their debt.
3. Potential Financial Loss: If liquidations occur, borrowers may suffer unnecessary financial losses.
4. Reduced Trust in Protocol: Users may lose confidence in the protocol if they find themselves unable to repay loans during critical times.

### PoC

Paste this in PositionManager.t.sol:

```solidity
function testCannotRepayWhenPaused() public {
        // Setup: Create a position and borrow
        vm.startPrank(positionOwner);

        // Deposit collateral
        uint256 collateralAmount = 100 ether;
        asset2.mint(positionOwner, collateralAmount);
        Action[] memory setupActions = new Action[](2);
        setupActions[0] = addToken(address(asset2));
        setupActions[1] = deposit(address(asset2), collateralAmount);
        asset2.approve(address(positionManager), collateralAmount);
        positionManager.processBatch(position, setupActions);

        // Borrow a smaller amount to ensure the position stays healthy
        uint256 borrowAmount = 1 ether; // Reduced from 10 ether
        Action memory borrowAction = borrow(linearRatePool, borrowAmount);
        positionManager.process(position, borrowAction);

        vm.stopPrank();

        // Pause the PositionManager
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        positionManager.togglePause();

        // Try to repay when paused
        vm.startPrank(positionOwner);
        uint256 repayAmount = 0.5 ether; // Reduced from 5 ether
        Action memory repayAction = repay(linearRatePool, repayAmount);

        vm.expectRevert("Pausable: paused");
        positionManager.process(position, repayAction);

        // Check the current debt
        uint256 debtBefore = pool.getBorrowsOf(linearRatePool, position);

        // Advance time to accrue interest
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);

        // Try to repay again
        vm.expectRevert("Pausable: paused");
        positionManager.process(position, repayAction);

        // Check that debt has increased due to accrued interest
        uint256 debtAfter = pool.getBorrowsOf(linearRatePool, position);
        assertGt(debtAfter, debtBefore, "Debt should have increased due to accrued interest");

        // Unpause and verify repayment is now possible
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        positionManager.togglePause();

        vm.startPrank(positionOwner);
        // Ensure the position has enough balance to repay
        asset1.mint(position, repayAmount);
        positionManager.process(position, repayAction);

        uint256 debtAfterRepay = pool.getBorrowsOf(linearRatePool, position);
        assertLt(debtAfterRepay, debtAfter, "Debt should have decreased after repayment");

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
Paste this in BaseTest.t.sol:

```solidity
function repay(uint256 poolId, uint256 amt) internal pure returns (Action memory) {
        bytes memory data = abi.encodePacked(poolId, amt);
        Action memory action = Action({ op: Operation.Repay, data: data });
        return action;
    }
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement an emergency repayment function:
Create a separate function for repayments that isn't subject to the pause mechanism.

```solidity
function emergencyRepay(address position, uint256 poolId, uint256 amount) external nonReentrant {
    if(!PausableUpgradeable.paused()) revert();
    // Implement repayment logic here
    // Ensure only repayment is allowed, not further borrowing
}
```

2. Automatic interest freeze:
Modify the Pool contract to automatically freeze interest accrual when the PositionManager is paused.

```solidity
function accrue(PoolData storage pool, uint256 id) internal {
    if (positionManager.paused()) return; // Skip accrual if paused
    // Existing accrual logic
}
```

3. Implement a time-delayed pause:
Add a delay between initiating a pause and it taking effect, allowing users time to adjust their positions.

```solidity
uint256 public constant PAUSE_DELAY = 6 hours;
uint256 public pauseInitiatedAt;

function initiatePause() external onlyOwner {
    pauseInitiatedAt = block.timestamp;
}

function completePause() external onlyOwner {
    require(block.timestamp >= pauseInitiatedAt + PAUSE_DELAY, "Pause delay not elapsed");
    _pause();
}
```

4. Allow repayments during pause:
Modify the process function to allow repayment operations even when paused.

```solidity
function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant {
    if (paused() && action.op != Operation.Repay) revert();
    // Existing process logic
}
```
