# User's position can be unfairly liquidated when PositionManager is paused

## Summary
User's position can be unfairly liquidated when PositionManager is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail

During a period of time that PositionManager is paused, a user is not allowed to process actions on theirs position, including repaying their positions debt.
[PositionManager.sol#L229-L232](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L229-L232):
```solidity
    function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```
[PositionManager.sol#L248-L264](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L248-L264):
```solidity
    function _process(address position, Action calldata action) internal {
        if (action.op == Operation.NewPosition) {
            newPosition(position, action.data);
            return;
        }

        if (!isAuth[position][msg.sender]) revert PositionManager_OnlyPositionAuthorized(position, msg.sender);

        if (action.op == Operation.Exec) exec(position, action.data);
        else if (action.op == Operation.Transfer) transfer(position, action.data);
        else if (action.op == Operation.Deposit) deposit(position, action.data);
        else if (action.op == Operation.Approve) approve(position, action.data);
@>      else if (action.op == Operation.Repay) repay(position, action.data);
        else if (action.op == Operation.Borrow) borrow(position, action.data);
        else if (action.op == Operation.AddToken) addToken(position, action.data);
        else if (action.op == Operation.RemoveToken) removeToken(position, action.data);
    }
```

However, liquidation is not blocked during the period, and the user's position can be unfairly liquidated due to that they cannot repay. Even though user can still deposit by transferring collaterals directly to their position, in a downtrend, user will be forced to transferring more and more collaterals and eventually run out of funds.

## Impact
User's position is unfairly liquidated.

## Recommendation
Liquidation should not be allowed when PositionManager is paused. Besides, consider adding a grace period after unpausing during which liquidation remains blocked to allow users to avoid liquidation front-running by closing their positions.
