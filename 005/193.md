# Liquidation are allowed, while repay/ increase collateral operations are blocked during a pause

## Summary
When the `positionManager.sol`, all operations to repay or  increase the collateral of a position in order to improve the position health is blocked, while the `liquidate()` function is not blocked during a pause.
This can lead to situations, specially when the `PositionManager.sol` contract is Paused, when protocol users are unfairly liquidated, when they couldn't possibly repay/ improve the health of their position


## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see from the code in `PositionManager.sol`, the `process()` and `processBatch()` have the `whenNotPaused` modifier
```js
    function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
```

```js
    function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
```

while the liquidate() function which is callable by all users and doesn't have the `whenNotPaused` modifier

```js

    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
```

Not having the `whenNotPaused` modifier on liquidate() makes it possible to liquidate users positions when the position manager is paused and while operations like repay or deposit will not work.
## Impact
Specially knowing that sentiment is a leveraged lending protocols, where borrowers position is exposed more to the risk of liquidations.
Blocking all operations from borrowers to improve their position health, while allowing liquidators, the ability to liquidate it, could lead users positions being unfairly liquidated during a pause.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The simplest solution would be to add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `liquidate()` function

The best possible solution, would be to implement something to the avev3.1 newly introduced gracePeriod mechanism.
After unpausing, the admin is able to set a period of time (<4hours), where positions could be repaid/ collateral increased, while liquidations are still paused
