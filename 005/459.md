# Borrowers are suceptible to liquidation while repay is on hold

## Summary
The protocol implements a method of combining all possible actions to be carried out by borrowers to a single function call `Positionmanager.process()`. This function carries the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which means no actions can be carried out by borrowers in a paused state. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Although certain actions like `borrow`, `deposit` and  `transfer` should be put on hold in a paused state to handle emergency situations. However borrowers will be succeptible to liquidation as `repay` will be inactive while liquidation is active in a paused state.

## Impact
Variation in market prices in a paused state can affect the safety of user positions, which users should be able to avoid by depositing more collateral as back up, or by repaying the loan. SInce neither of these actions can be carried out in a paused state, the liquidators can take advantage of every pause time to liquidate such affected borrowers within the protocol

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I  cannot suggest a solution that does not  slightly reengineer the architecture of the system. Consider separating the  logic that handles repay from the other actions
