# Paused `PositionManager` Prevents Collateral Deposits, Leading to Liquidation Exposure

## Summary
When `PositionManager` is paused, position owners are unable to add collateral to their positions, while still subject to liquidation, if their positions become unhealthy.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, both [PositionManager::process](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L229) and [processBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L238) functions have the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which restricts calls to only when the `PositionManager` is unpaused, this thus makes it impossible to deposit collateral to an unhealthy position, while the contract is paused. 

While paused [PositionManager::liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L430-L444) function can still be called by anyone to liquidate this unhealthy position.

## Impact
In the event were the Position Manager is paused. Due to market actions, unhealthy positions will have no way to deposit collateral and thus be subject to liquidation without any remedy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the whenNotPaused modifier from both `PositionManager::process` and `processBatch` functions.

Consider adding this restriction directly to these internal functions instead:
+ exec
+ transfer
+ approve
+ borrow
+ removeToken
+ newPosition
