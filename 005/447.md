# DOS in Position Manager when the Position Owner wants to avoid its Liquidation.

### Summary

Position Owner can only call  `repay`  using `process()` or `processBatch()` function. And these function can be paused by the PositionManager contract owner. As a result  , when a position owner observes that  their collateral assets value is going below the LTV for their deposit in the pool , position cant repay to save itself from liquidation by repaying.


### Root Cause

`Repay()` is an [internal function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L359C1-L362C9) which can be called only throught `process()` or `processBatch()` which has a [`whenNotPaused` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L238) modifier.

Repay() should be made public . SInce by repaying its assure that a position wont become unhealthy from a healthy positoini.So need not to check the health status at the end of the function as done in process() or processBatch()
