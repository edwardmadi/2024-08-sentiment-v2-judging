# Pausing the position manager disables `addToken` function

## Summary
`Process()` and `processBatch()` are the only entry points to perform operations on a position, due to the whenNotPaused modifier, when the position manager is paused they are paused too and user cannot perform operations on his position . This prevents borrowers
from adding new tokens as collateral to their position, which could result in the borrowers not being
able to keep their position healthy.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is an example of such scenario:

1. A borrower opens a position with a collateral token and borrows
2.  Position manager as well as the pool of the
collateral token is paused for good reasons by the `protocolOwner`
3. The collateral of the borrower losses value
4. As the pool is paused the borrower is not able to get more tokens and increase the collateral of the
position
5. Also as the addToken function is paused the borrower is not able to add a new collateral token to
the position
The same could happen with another token that is for any reason not available at the given moment

### CodedPOC
run the following command in your terminal `forge test --match-path test/core/PositionManager.t.sol --match-test testAddTokenRevertsWhenPositionManagerIsPaused`

```solidity
function testAddTokenRevertsWhenPositionManagerIsPaused() public {
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        PositionManager(positionManager).togglePause();

        vm.startPrank(positionOwner);

        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](1);
        actions[0] = addToken(address(asset2));

        vm.expectRevert();
        PositionManager(positionManager).processBatch(position, actions);

    }
```

In `positionManager.sol`
Both external facing functions that the user can call to `addToken` have the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

## Impact
User positions will be unfairly liquidated because he cannot add collateral to his position.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
apply `whenNotPaused` specifically to position operations you want to pause when the contract is paused and not the whole `process()` or `processBatch()` function
