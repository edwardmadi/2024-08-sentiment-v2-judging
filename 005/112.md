# Based on Flow in the Pool.sol user should be able to repay when the pool is paused but user will not be able to Repay and Deposit Collateral(to prevent liquidation) when the Position Manager is Paused

## Summary
In the current implementation of the `Pool.sol` contract, there is an issue where users are unable to repay or deposit collateral when the Position Manager is paused . This unintended behavior can put users at risk of liquidation, as they are unable to take necessary actions to maintain or extend their positions. 


## Vulnerability Detail

The `Pool.sol` contract includes functionality to pause various operations, such as deposits and borrows, in order to restrict certain activities during abnormal conditions. While the intent is to allow users to repay, withdraw, liquidate, and clear bad debt even when the pool is paused, there is a flaw in the current implementation. When the Position Manager is paused, users are prevented from repaying or depositing additional collateral to their positions, which contradicts the intended flow of the contract. This restriction can lead to unintended consequences, such as users being unable to prevent liquidation by adding tokens or repaying their debt.


  Only deposit and Borrow can be Paused 

```solidity

@audit >>>>   /// @notice Toggle paused state for a pool to restrict deposit and borrows
                          function togglePause(uint256 poolId) external {
                             if (msg.sender != ownerOf[poolId]) revert Pool_OnlyPoolOwner(poolId, msg.sender);
                            PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];
                           pool.isPaused = !pool.isPaused;
                          emit PoolPauseToggled(poolId, pool.isPaused);
    }
```
But to interact with Repay user as to use Position Manager which has it's own pause mechanism.

```solidity

  /// @notice Process a single action on a given position
    /// @param position Position address
    /// @param action Action config
 
@audit >> We should be able to repay even when paused>>    function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
 
          _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }

    /// @notice Procces a batch of actions on a given position
    /// @dev only one position can be operated on in one txn, including creation
    /// @param position Position address
    /// @param actions List of actions to process

@audit >> We should be able to repay even when paused>>     function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
      
        // loop over actions and process them sequentially based on operation
        uint256 actionsLength = actions.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < actionsLength; ++i) {
            _process(position, actions[i]);
        }
        // after all the actions are processed, the position should be within risk thresholds
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```

3. Liquidation is implemented correctly has a position can be liquidated even when the contract is paused.

```solidity

 /// @notice Liquidate an unhealthy position
    /// @param position Position address
    /// @param debtData DebtData object for debts to be repaid
    /// @param assetData AssetData object for assets to be seized

@audit >> As it should be here ANYONE can liquidate when paused>>      function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
        riskEngine.validateLiquidation(position, debtData, assetData);

        // liquidate
        _transferAssetsToLiquidator(position, assetData);
        _repayPositionDebt(position, debtData);

        // position should be within risk thresholds after liquidation
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
        emit Liquidation(position, msg.sender, ownerOf[position]);
    }
```


## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is significant as it creates a Denial of Service (DoS) condition for users trying to manage their positions during a paused state. Specifically, users are unable to repay their debt or deposit collateral, which can result in the liquidation of their positions. This behavior undermines the intended design of the contract, where users should be able to take actions to maintain their positions even during a pause.

```solidity
function testFullRepay2() public {
    testSimpleBorrow();

    uint256 borrow = pool.getBorrowsOf(linearRatePool, position);

    bytes memory data = abi.encode(linearRatePool, borrow);

    asset1.mint(position, 5 ether);

    Action memory action = Action({ op: Operation.Repay, data: data });
   Action[] memory actions = new Action[](1);
    actions[0] = action;

    // Ensure the pause is toggled only by the legitimate owner
    vm.startPrank(positionManager.owner());
    positionManager.togglePause();
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(positionOwner);
    assertEq(Position(position).getDebtPools().length, 1);

    PositionManager(positionManager).processBatch(position, actions);

    assertEq(Position(position).getDebtPools().length, 0);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, a separate process function should be created using a modifier that allows certain operations to be executed even when the contract is paused. This function should specifically enable users to repay their debt, deposit collateral into their positions, and add tokens to maintain the solvency of their positions. By implementing this solution, the contract will ensure that users can manage their positions during a paused state, thereby preserving the intended flow and preventing unintended liquidations.
