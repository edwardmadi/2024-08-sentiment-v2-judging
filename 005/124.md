# Borrowers cannot repay when positionManager is paused, but they can still be unfairly liquidated

### Summary

When the protocol is paused users cannot repay their loans, but they still accumulate interest and can still get liquidated. This is unfair since the borrower could have repaid the loan and avoided the loss of funds due to liqudation if the protocol allowed repays during a paused state. 

Consider the following scenario

1. User puts down 100 ETH worth of collateral to borrow 85 ETH worth of USDC, he start to accumulate interest
2. The `PositionManager` is paused, but the user still accumulates interest
3. The borrower tries to repay the loan but it reverts
4. The borrower gets liquidated by a liquidator

### Root Cause

[process](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/25a0c8aeaddec273c5318540059165696591ecfb/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L229) function, which is used to call the internal `repay` function has a `whenNotPaused` modifier

### Internal pre-conditions

PositionManager contract is paused

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Honest borrower is unfairly liquidated 

Honest user is unfairly accumulating interest and cannot repay it

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

2 ways to do this

1. Allow repayments when paused

2. Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `liquidate()` function, implement a grace period post unpausing to block liquidations so users can repay the loan
