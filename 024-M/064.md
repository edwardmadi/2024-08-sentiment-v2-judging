# Sequencer feed is not applicable for L1 and some Layer 2.

## Summary
Sequencer feed is not applicable for L1 and some Layer 2.

## Vulnerability Detail
In ChainlinkEthOracle, we will check whether sequencer is up. If the sequencer is down, the return result might be stale. 
But the problem is that chainlink sequencer uptime feed is only for some Layer2, for example, arb, op, base chain. There is not one sequencer uptime feed for Layer1 and some other layer2s. 
From readme, the sponsor mentions that `the smart contracts will be deployed to Any EVM-compatbile network.` If we deploy Sentiment to Layer 1 or some other Layer2 which does not support chainlink sequencer feed, we cannot find one valid sequencer feed. This will cause `getValueInEth` failure.

```solidity
    function getValueInEth(address asset, uint256 amt) external view returns (uint256) {
        _checkSequencerFeed();

        // [ROUND] price is rounded down. this is used for both debt and asset math, neutral effect.
        return amt.mulDiv(_getPriceWithSanityChecks(asset), (10 ** IERC20Metadata(asset).decimals()));
    }
    function _checkSequencerFeed() private view {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt,,) = ARB_SEQ_FEED.latestRoundData();

        // answer == 0 -> sequncer up
        // answer == 1 -> sequencer down
        if (answer != 0) revert ChainlinkEthOracle_SequencerDown();
        if (startedAt == 0) revert ChainlinkEthOracle_InvalidRound();

        if (block.timestamp - startedAt <= SEQ_GRACE_PERIOD) revert ChainlinkEthOracle_GracePeriodNotOver();
    }
```

## Impact
Chainlink oracle will not work on Layer 1 and some other Layer2 which does not support Chainlink sequencer feed.

## Recommendation
In Layer 1 or some other layer 2 chains, set `ARB_SEQ_FEED` = address(0), and bypass the `_checkSequencerFeed()` when the `ARB_SEQ_FEED` equal address(0).
