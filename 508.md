# Interest accrual during the pause period forces borrowers to incur additional interest charges

## Summary
Every call made to the `positionmanager.repay()` function leads to an internal call `pool.simulateAcrrue()`, which also makes a direct call to the `getInterestAccrued` method of the rate model that the pool implements. This interest is calculated based on the difference of the current `block.timestamp` and the last updated time of repayment. However this does not take into account, any pause time experienced, which adversely increases the repay amount that borrowers have to pay 
## Vulnerability Detail
Rate factor calculations from the `getInterestAccrued` method in all the interest models have (time delta) which is `((block.timestamp - lastUpdated))` as a numerator, which can get bigger as the value of `block.timestamp` increases  in a pause state. This is unfair on users, having to pay the accumulated amount of interest accrued over time due to the pause 
## Impact
Users might be forced to pay more interests on their loans
