# Overlap of rate model Type if rate model is updated

### Summary

The `Pool.sol` allows owner of the Pools to update their rateModel using `requestRateModelUpdate()`. While the pool Id is created using the below expression. If the Pool was initially created will **FixedRateModel** and later updated to **LinerRateModel**. The owner won't be able to create another **FixedRateModel** for same asset and the **poolId** will collide. Now, there can exist 2 PoolIds for an owner with same asset and 2 **LinerRateModel** and 0 **FixedRateModel**.

`poolId = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, asset, rateModelKey)));`

### Root Cause

The update doesn't consider the possible **poolId** collide for rate model changes on existing pool.  `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L575`

### Attack Path

1. Owner creates a Pool for USDC with **FixedRateModel**.
2. Now Owner updates the USDC rate model with **LinerRateModel**.
3. Now if the Owner tries to create another USDC pool with  **FixedRateModel** it'll revert even though there are no **FixedRateModel** for USDC but the **poolId** will collide.
4. The Owner will be able to create **LinerRateModel** for USDC and there can exist 2 pools with same rate model type.
