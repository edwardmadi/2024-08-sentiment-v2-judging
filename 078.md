# The protocol does not support the WETH token

## Summary
WETH is a very common token on the Ethereum blockchain; however, `_getValueOf()` in the protocol does not support it.

## Vulnerability Detail
WETH is a very common token on the Ethereum blockchain; however, the protocol only supports oracles relative to ETH. The WETH:ETH ratio should be 1:1, but `_getValueOf()` will not function correctly in this case.
```solidity
    function _getValueOf(address asset, uint256 amt) internal view returns (uint256) {
        address oracle = RiskEngine(riskEngine).getOracleFor(asset);
        return IOracle(oracle).getValueInEth(asset, amt);
    }

```

## Impact
The protocol does not support the WETH token.
