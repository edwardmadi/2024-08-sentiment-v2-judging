# Protocol does not account for tokens with different decimals (USDC)

## Summary

In the README it is specified that USDC will be used but it has 6 decimals unlike other standard ERC20 tokens which have 18 decimals. The code assumes that all tokens will have 18 decimals which will lead to wrong calculations and unfair liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `RiskModule::_getPositionAssetData` the weight of each asset is calculated and then it is required that the debt is backed proportionally:
```solidity
                // debt is weighted in proportion to value of position assets. if your position
                // consists of 60% A and 40% B, then 60% of the debt is assigned to be backed by A
                // and 40% by B. this is iteratively computed for each pool the position borrows from
```

But if we take a look at how the weight is calculated:

```solidity
    function _getPositionAssetData(address position)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256, address[] memory, uint256[] memory)
    {
        uint256 totalAssetValue;

        address[] memory positionAssets = Position(payable(position)).getPositionAssets();
        uint256 positionAssetsLength = positionAssets.length;
        uint256[] memory positionAssetData = new uint256[](positionAssetsLength);

        for (uint256 i; i < positionAssetsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 assets = getAssetValue(position, positionAssets[i]);
            // positionAssetData[i] stores value of positionAssets[i] in eth
            positionAssetData[i] = assets;
            totalAssetValue += assets;
        }

        if (totalAssetValue == 0) return (0, positionAssets, positionAssetData);

        for (uint256 i; i < positionAssetsLength; ++i) {
            // positionAssetData[i] stores weight of positionAsset[i]
            // wt of positionAsset[i] = (value of positionAsset[i]) / (total position assets value)
@>          positionAssetData[i] = positionAssetData[i].mulDiv(1e18, totalAssetValue);
        }

        return (totalAssetValue, positionAssets, positionAssetData);
    }
```

`totalAssetValue` will have 18 decimals if they have deposited any other asset apart from USDC but `positionAssetData[i]` will have 6 decimals when talking about USDC. Because of that the contract will require that an extremely small part of the loan to be covered by USDC even if USDC is the biggest in actual value which will lead to unfair liquidations.

## Impact

Unfair liquidations and wrong calculations in the protocol when USDC is involved.

## Recommendation

Multiply USDC by e12 in order to match it to other 18 decimals tokens.
