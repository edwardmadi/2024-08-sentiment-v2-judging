# Borrowers can experience temporary denial of acces to thier funds with the protocol

## Summary
The `positionmanger.transfer()` function  checks against delisted assets. Borrowers who have own assets of this type within the protocal will be denied from calling `transfer` can will not have access to their assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the current architecture of the system users cannot transfer out their asset, if it is no longer supported by the protocol. The current implementation only suggests that delisted assets have to be reallowed temporarily for users to have access to their funds. However reallowing the asset temporarily also gives room for other users to deposit such asset as collateral by backrunning the `positionmanager.toggleKnownAsset()` function call 
## Impact
Denial of access to user funds
