# User's funds could get stuck in the case of an owner removing a token from the known assets

## Summary
User's funds could get stuck in the case of an owner removing a token from the known assets
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can deposit a token marked as a known asset by the user into their position contract. However, if at a later point, the owner removes that token from being known, users will not be able to transfer out their tokens from the position due to this check in `PositionManager::transfer()`:
```solidity
if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);
```
This will leave the funds stuck in that contract.
## Impact
User's funds could get stuck in the case of an owner removing a token from the known assets

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Let users transfer out tokens even if they are not known as that doesn't really cause any issues
