# Users assets will be locked up in their position if the protocol remove the asset from `isKnownAsset`

## Summary
When an asset is removed from `isKnownAsset` in `PositionManager.sol`, users may be unable to retrieve their locked tokens, which can also cause a DoS during liquidation if the asset reverts on oracle price fetches.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `PositionManager.sol`, every asset that a user wants to interact with should be whitelisted in the `isKnownAsset` mapping. For example, [while making a deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L334):
```solidity
        // mitigate unknown assets being locked in positions
        if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_DepositUnknownAsset(asset);
```

The admin of the protocol has the ability to [de-whitelist an asset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L522) using `toggleKnownAsset`:
```solidity
    function toggleKnownAsset(address asset) external onlyOwner {
        isKnownAsset[asset] = !isKnownAsset[asset];
        emit ToggleKnownAsset(asset, isKnownAsset[asset]);
    }
```

When a token is removed from isKnownAsset, users have the ability to [remove that token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L418-L424) from their position using removeToken:
```solidity
    function removeToken(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address)
        // asset -> address of asset to be deregistered as collateral
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        Position(payable(position)).removeToken(asset);
        emit RemoveToken(position, msg.sender, asset);
    }
```
However, since users are unable to transfer or approve the amount of that token to themselves, their assets may become locked in the positions. If this token also causes a revert on oracle actions (such as getting a price), then the liquidation of this position can also be DoSed.

## Impact
There are multiple impacts of this bug:

- User assets may become locked in the contract.
- If this token causes a revert when fetching the price from the oracle and the position becomes unhealthy, liquidation may be DoSed.
- There might be an approval on these tokens, which would allow the spender to still transfer the tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is acceptable to prevent users from depositing unknown assets, but the protocol should allow them to transfer their tokens when they are removed.

```diff
    function removeToken(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address)
        // asset -> address of asset to be deregistered as collateral
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));

+       uint256 balance = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);
+       if ( balance > 0 ) Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, asset, balance);
+       
        Position(payable(position)).removeToken(asset);
        emit RemoveToken(position, msg.sender, asset);
    }
```
