# Deposited assets in a position can be stuck if suddenly they are removed from whitelisted

## Summary

When users deposit assets in a position the address of the token is checked if it is `isKnownAsset`. Then if this check passes the position owner can add it to his set of position assets. The same `isKnownAsset` check is used for approving a spender to use assets from a position or transfering the assets out of the position. 

Know assets are added or removed through `toggleKnownAsset()` function protected by the onlyOwner modifier

[PositionManager::toggleKnownAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L522-L525)
```solidity
function toggleKnownAsset(address asset) external onlyOwner { 
        isKnownAsset[asset] = !isKnownAsset[asset];
        emit ToggleKnownAsset(asset, isKnownAsset[asset]);
    }
```
In case when an asset address is removed from `isKnownAsset` mapping , users who have open positions and deposit with the particular asset won't be able to transfer it out and will be stuck in the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. When a whitelisted asset is being removed from the owner of the protocol users who had deposited the particular asset in their position wont be able to transfer it out which will stuck their collateral in the protocol. 
2. In case a `userA` has a debt collateralized with the removed asset and the value of the asset drops down and his position can become unhealthy and liquidatable.
 A) He won't be able to deposit into his position because of the `isKnownAsset` check in the `PositionManager::deposit()` . 
 B) Then `userB` , who is a liquidator with collateralized position, sees the unhealthy position of  `userA` ,
   1) He still doesn't know that `userA collateralized asset is removed from the whitelist`, liquidates `userA` and will receive the `removed asset` from the `liquidated position`, pay the debt and when he tries to transfer out the asset he just received the tx will revert and he will end with stuck and frozen assets till eventually it is whitelisted again , which can be crucial if he wants to sell them immidiately because of economical reasons.
   2) He knows that the `colateralized asset is not whitelisted` and has no incentives to liquidate him and `userA` will have `unliquidatable unhealthy position`.  

## Impact

Positions with removed `isKnowAsset` will have stuck collateral which can lead to liquidatable positions or economical loses for them or the liquidators.

```solidity
function deposit(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address, uint256)
        // asset -> [0:20] address of token to be deposited
        // amt -> [20: 52] amount of asset to be deposited
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[20:52]));

        // mitigate unknown assets being locked in positions
@>>  if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_DepositUnknownAsset(asset);

        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, position, amt);
        emit Deposit(position, msg.sender, asset, amt);
    }
```

[PositionManager::transfer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L307-L323)
```solidity
function transfer(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address, address, uint256)
        // recipient -> [0:20] address that will receive the transferred tokens
        // asset -> [20:40] address of token to be transferred
        // amt -> [40:72] amount of asset to be transferred
        address recipient = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[20:40]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[40:72]));

@>>  if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);

        // if the passed amt is type(uint).max assume transfer of the entire balance
        if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);

        Position(payable(position)).transfer(recipient, asset, amt);
        emit Transfer(position, msg.sender, recipient, asset, amt);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Even if asset token is removed from `isKnowAsset` now, allow users to transfer them out. After all you have health check that will guarantee that the position is healthy.
