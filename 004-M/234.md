# Deposited Assets are Stuck in Positions, When the Asset is No Longer Recognized

## Summary
Position owners lose their deposited assets if the asset is no longer accepted by the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

If for instance, USDC is previously accepted by the protocol, and at this time, the user Bob deposits some USDC into his position, if at a later time, USDC becomes no longer a recognized asset, via an admin call to [PositionManager::toggleKnownAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L522-L525) function.
 Withdrawal from the position via a call to [PositionManager::transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L307-L323) function will no longer be possible, due to the below check:
```solidity
    if (!isKnownAsset[asset])
            revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);

```
Since USDC is no longer an accepted asset, the token stays stuck in bob's position.

## Impact
unknown positions assets are stuck.

## Recommendation

If an asset is no longer accepted by the protocol, allow position owners to be able to transfer out this asset from their positions.
