# Insufficient Balance Check and Allowance Underflow Vulnerability in Token Transfer Functions

## Summary
The `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the provided Solidity code lack crucial checks and safeguards, potentially leading to issues like insufficient balance handling and allowance underflow. 

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Lack of Balance Check in `transfer` Function:**
   - **Issue:** The `transfer` function does not verify if the caller (`msg.sender`) has enough balance before attempting the transfer. If the balance is insufficient, this could lead to an underflow in the balance state, resulting in unintended behavior.
   - **Potential Impact:** This oversight can lead to incorrect balance updates, where balances might become negative (if using unchecked arithmetic), or other unintended consequences.

   ```solidity
   //@audit if (balanceOf[sender][id] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance(sender, id);
   ```

2. **Allowance Underflow in `transferFrom` Function:**
   - **Issue:** The `transferFrom` function does not check if the `allowance` is sufficient before subtracting the `amount`. This could lead to an allowance underflow if the `amount` exceeds the current allowance.
   - **Potential Impact:** If the allowance is not properly checked before the subtraction, it can lead to incorrect allowance values and potential security issues such as unauthorized transfers.

   ```solidity
   //@audit require(allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] >= amount, "insufficient allowance");
   ```

   Additionally, if the `allowance` is equal to `type(uint256).max`, the code does not correctly handle the underflow situation. Although the intention might be to clear the allowance, not checking against underflow can be problematic.

   ```solidity
   //@audit underflow of allowed amount is not enough to handle amounts
   ```
## Impact

- **Balance Check Issue:** Can lead to negative balances or unintended contract states if not handled properly.
- **Allowance Underflow:** Can result in underflow if don't have enough values,

```solidity
function transfer(
    address receiver,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
) public virtual returns (bool) {
    //@audit Missing balance check
    balanceOf[msg.sender][id] -= amount;
    balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, msg.sender, receiver, id, amount);
    return true;
}

function transferFrom(
    address sender,
    address receiver,
    uint256 id,
    uint256 amount
) public virtual returns (bool) {
    if (msg.sender != sender && !isOperator[sender][msg.sender]) {
        uint256 allowed = allowance[sender][msg.sender][id];
        //@audit Missing allowance check
        if (allowed != type(uint256).max) {
            allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] = allowed - amount;
        }
    }
    balanceOf[sender][id] -= amount;
    balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;
    emit Transfer(msg.sender, sender, receiver, id, amount);
    return true;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. **For `transfer` Function:**
   - Add a balance check before deducting the amount to ensure the sender has sufficient balance.

   ```solidity
   require(balanceOf[msg.sender][id] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
   ```

2. **For `transferFrom` Function:**
   - Add a check to ensure the allowance is sufficient before performing the subtraction.

   ```solidity
   require(allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] >= amount, "Insufficient allowance");
   ```
