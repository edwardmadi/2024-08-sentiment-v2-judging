# Zero Address Token Sinkhole in ERC6909 Implementation

## Summary
The ERC6909 implementation lacks the necessary checks for `address(0)` in several critical functions such as `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `setOperator`, and `_approve`. This omission allows tokens to be transferred, approved, or assigned to a null address, leading to potential token loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
- `transfer` function:
If `receiver` is `address(0)`, then the token will be "lost" because it is transferred to an inaccessible null address. This can happen if the user accidentally or intentionally enters `address(0)` as the recipient.
`balanceOf[msg.sender][id] -= amount;`
`balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;`

- `transferFrom` function:
If `receiver` is `address(0)`, the token will be transferred to an inaccessible null address, making the token inaccessible. This can happen if an unauthorized user or operator tries to transfer the token to `address(0)`.
`if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] = allowed - amount;`
`balanceOf[sender][id] -= amount;`
`balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;`

- `setOperator` function:
If `operator` is `address(0)`, then the operator status will be set to a null address, which makes no sense and can cause confusion or security issues. For example, a user could accidentally set `address(0)` as a valid operator.
`isOperator[msg.sender][operator] = approved;`

- `_approve` function:
If `spender` is `address(0)`, then the token allocation will be given to a null address, which cannot be used to perform token transfers. This can happen if the user accidentally or intentionally sets `address(0)` as the spender.
`allowance[msg.sender][spender][id] = amount;`

## Impact
- Tokens transferred or minted to address(0) are irretrievably lost, reducing the total supply of tokens available to users.
- Setting address(0) as an operator or spender can lead to undefined behavior and potential security loopholes, as the zero address is not a valid participant in the network.
- Allowing operations involving address(0) can disrupt the normal functioning of the token contract, leading to unexpected behaviors and potential financial losses for users.

## Impact on Pool contracts:
1. `Deposit` function:
`IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);`
- If `msg.sender` is `address(0)`, the transfer will fail or the token will be lost.
- If `address(this)` is `address(0)`, the token will be lost because it was sent to `address(0)`.
2. `Withdraw` function:
`IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransfer(receiver, assets);`
- If the `receiver` is `address(0)`, the asset will be lost because it was sent to `address(0)`.
3. `Borrow` function:
`IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(position, amt - fee);`
- If the `position` is `address(0)`, the asset will be lost because it is sent to `address(0)`.
4. `Relay` function:
`// Assume that the assets have been transferred to the contract before calling this function`
- If `msg.sender` is `address(0)`, the assets that should be used to settle the debt may never reach the contract, causing a failure to settle the debt.
5. `setPoolOwner` function:
`ownerOf[poolId] = newOwner;`
- If `newOwner` is `address(0)`, the pool will become inaccessible because there is no valid owner to manage the pool.

## Tool used

- Manual Review
- Foundry

## Recommendation
Add a require(address != address(0)) check to every function that assigns a value to the address state variable.
- `transfer` function:
```diff
function transfer(address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
+   require(receiver != address(0), "Transfer to the zero address");

    balanceOf[msg.sender][id] -= amount;
    balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, msg.sender, receiver, id, amount);

    return true;
}
```
- `transferFrom` function:
```diff
function transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
+   require(receiver != address(0), "Transfer to the zero address");

    if (msg.sender != sender && !isOperator[sender][msg.sender]) {
        uint256 allowed = allowance[sender][msg.sender][id];
        if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] = allowed - amount;
    }

    balanceOf[sender][id] -= amount;
    balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, sender, receiver, id, amount);

    return true;
}
```
- `setOperator` function:
```diff
function setOperator(address operator, bool approved) public virtual returns (bool) {
+   require(operator != address(0), "Set operator to the zero address");

    isOperator[msg.sender][operator] = approved;

    emit OperatorSet(msg.sender, operator, approved);

    return true;
}
```
-  `_approve` function:
```diff
function _approve(address spender, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
+   require(spender != address(0), "Approve to the zero address");

    allowance[msg.sender][spender][id] = amount;

    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, id, amount);
}
```
