# Missing price validations for RedstoneOracle can compromise protocol's integrity

## Summary
In the **RedstoneOracle**, a malicious actor could submit invalid price, such as 0, when there is an error. Although not impossible, its very unlikely that this issue would occur.

## Vulnerability Detail

Redstone oracle uses an "on-demand" model, which allows for lower fees as the price is not constantly pushed. Instead, anyone can submit off-chain signed data that can be validated with the Redstone SDK. Check out the docs [here](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/get-started/models/redstone-core).

It is possible to encounter a situation where the price is 0, although it should be very unlikely. Such scenarios can arise due to:
**Data Source Issues:** If all data sources provide a 0 price (e.g., in case of a market failure or misconfiguration).
**Incorrect Data Handling:** Bugs or issues in the aggregation/sdk logic that might incorrectly return a price of 0.

## Impact
The impact would be significant as if someone managed to the price to 0. This could lead to mass liquidations.

## Proof of Concept
All of the oracles in the protocol provide the `getValueInEth` function, and one of its main purposes is to ensure that the `LTV` ratio is healthy. Having 0 price, could lead to mass liquidations, as every position can suddenly become unhealthy.

`PositionManager.liquidate()` is validating the position health using an oracle -> [liquidate code snippet.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L435)  and [validate code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L117)

 isPositionHealthy is using `_getPositionDebtData` and `_getPositionAssetData` which use `getAssetValue` and `getDebtValueForPool`. And the values are in ETH, which depends on the Oracle.
 
```solidity
    function getDebtValueForPool(address position, uint256 poolId) public view returns (uint256) {
        address asset = pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId);
        IOracle oracle = IOracle(riskEngine.getOracleFor(asset));
@>>     return oracle.getValueInEth(asset, pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position));
    }
```
```solidity
    function getAssetValue(address position, address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
        IOracle oracle = IOracle(riskEngine.getOracleFor(asset));
        uint256 amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);
@>>     return oracle.getValueInEth(asset, amt);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate price is not 0, or above max.
```diff
    function updatePrice() external {
        // values[0] -> price of ASSET/USD
        // values[1] -> price of ETH/USD
        // values are scaled to 8 decimals
        uint256[] memory values = getOracleNumericValuesFromTxMsg(dataFeedIds);

        assetUsdPrice = values[0];
        ethUsdPrice = values[1];
        
+        if(assetUsdPrice == 0 || ethUsdPrice == 0 || ethUsdPrice > type(uint208).max || assetUsdPrice > type(uint208).max)  revert();
        // RedstoneDefaultLibs.sol enforces that prices are not older than 3 mins. since it is not
        // possible to retrieve timestamps for individual prices being passed, we consider the worst
        // case and assume both prices are 3 mins old
        priceTimestamp = block.timestamp - THREE_MINUTES;
    }
```
