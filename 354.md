# Users can inflate the utilization to inflate the interest rates, which can lead to loss of funds

### Summary
2/3 irms that the protocol implements use utilization as a way to determine what the interest rates would be for that specific pool. The 2 models are [`KinkedRateModel`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/irm/KinkedRateModel.sol#L56) and [`LinearRateModel`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/irm/LinearRateModel.sol#L67). The higher the utilization, the higher the interest rates.

When interest is accrued for a pool, it's added to `totalDepositAssets` and `totalBorrowAssets` for that specific pool. The key here is that both values are used for share conversion for both depositors and borrowers.

Knowing this, a user can inflate the utilization to 100% to massively increase the accrued interest. He can easily do this by:
- Depositing `minDebt/minBorrow` of asset tokens to a new pool.
- Borrowing the entire amount, backing it with some collateral.

Now the utilization is at 100% and the interest rate is at it's maximum. If left unchecked for some time, users who deposit into the pool might lose funds depending on `totalDepositAssets` and how large it's gotten. This will be showcased in **Attack Path**.
