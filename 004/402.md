# ChainlinkUsdOracle does not correctly scale down assets with greater than 18 decimals

## Summary
ChainlinkUsdOracle severely underestimates the value of assets with `> 18 decimals`.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Parenthesis are missing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkUsdOracle.sol#L86) when assets with `> 18 decimals` are being scaled down. The asset amount is scaled down by `10 ** decimals - 18`, when it should be scaled down by `10 ** (decimals - 18)`.  The result is an asset value that is severely underestimated. 

## Impact
Since the value of assets with `> 18 decimals` will be severely underestimated, a malicious user is able to borrow excess funds from the base pool if the affected asset is the borrow token of said pool.

Internal Conditions:
- Base pool uses borrow asset with decimals greater than 18
- Asset is configured with ChainlinkUsdOracle
- `minBorrow` and `minDebt` are both set to `0`

Given the high impact and the constraints listed above, I have chosen to label this report as Medium severity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When the asset has greater than 18 decimals, the amount of the asset should be scaled down by `10 ** (decimals - 18)` in the `ChainlinkUsdOracle::getValueInETH` function.
