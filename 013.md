# Potential Division by Zero in `getValueInEth` Function

## Vulnerability Detail
The getValueInEth function in the RedstoneCoreOracle contract is vulnerable to a potential division by zero error. This vulnerability can be triggered when the ethUsdPrice variable is zero or when calculations result in an effective zero value, leading to a revert during the division operation.

## Impact
If this issue is triggered, the transaction will revert, causing a denial of service for any function that relies on the getValueInEth function. In a financial context, this could disrupt critical operations such as collateral calculations, liquidation processes, or token swaps, leading to financial losses or system instability.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/RedstoneOracle.sol#L63

## Proof of Concept:
A fuzz test with the following inputs triggered the error:

- assetAmount: 185
- assetUsdPrice: 999999001054
- ethUsdPrice: 999900002152

These inputs, when used in the calculation, result in a division by zero error.

## Tool used
Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation
- The contract should have a mechanism to handle extreme market conditions where the ETH price might approach zero, even if such scenarios are unlikely.
- Consider adding events to log price updates, which can help in monitoring and debugging such issues.
