# `SuperPoolFactory.deploySuperPool()` could be dossed

## Summary
superPools in the factory are deployed using create, which make it possible for offchain attackers to guess the next deploy address, that will be deployed through the contract. 
By donating a small amount of tokens to that expected deploy address attackers are able to doss deployment of superPool through the Factory 


## Vulnerability Detail

The SuperPoolFactory contract in SuperPoolFactory.sol contains a  vulnerability related to the predictability of newly created SuperPool addresses. This predictability allows malicious actors to manipulate the initial share price of new pools, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS) or significantly increased costs for pool creation.

The issue stems from the deterministic nature of contract creation addresses. A malicious user can calculate the address of the next SuperPool to be deployed and send assets directly to this address before the pool is officially created. This pre-seeding of assets inflates the initial share price, as the contract considers these assets when minting the initial shares.

As a result, the cost to meet the MIN_BURNED_SHARES requirement increases substantially. This can lead to two severe outcomes:

1. DoS on pool creation: If the inflated cost exceeds the initialDepositAmt provided by the legitimate pool creator, the transaction will revert due to insufficient initial shares.

2. Increased creation costs: Pool creators may need to provide significantly more assets than anticipated to meet the MIN_BURNED_SHARES requirement, making pool creation prohibitively expensive.

This vulnerability undermines the fairness and accessibility of the pool creation process, potentially deterring legitimate users from creating new pools and compromising the protocol's growth and decentralization goals.

## Impact
- It is possible to make superPool creation revert + inital deposit more expensive
Because this is also sequential, user need to deploy the pools in the sequence and makes the attack more easy to perform
