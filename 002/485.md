# **Attacker Can Cause DoS in SuperPool Deployment**


## Summary

An attacker can exploit the predictable address of a newly deployed `SuperPool` contract to deposit assets before the contract is officially deployed. This leads to the initial deposit by the contract owner minting fewer than the required 1000 shares, causing a denial of service (DoS) on the contract deployment process.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new `SuperPool` is deployed, its address can be predicted using the contract's nonce and the deployer's address. An attacker can take advantage of this by sending assets to the precomputed address before the `SuperPool` contract is deployed. The factory contract relies on the initial deposit to mint a minimum of 1000 shares, which are then burned. However, if the attacker has already sent assets to the precomputed address, the initial deposit by the contract owner will mint fewer than 1000 shares, causing the deployment process to revert.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to effectively block the deployment of new `SuperPool` contracts by causing the `SuperPoolFactory_TooFewInitialShares` error to be triggered. The deployer would need to deposit 1000 times the amount of assets already present in the contract to meet the minimum share requirement, making it infeasible to deploy the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
SuperPool superPool = new SuperPool(POOL, asset, feeRecipient, fee, superPoolCap, name, symbol);
superPool.transferOwnership(owner);
isDeployerFor[address(superPool)] = true;

// burn initial deposit
IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), initialDepositAmt); // assume approval
IERC20(asset).approve(address(superPool), initialDepositAmt);
uint256 shares = superPool.deposit(initialDepositAmt, address(this));
if (shares < MIN_BURNED_SHARES) revert SuperPoolFactory_TooFewInitialShares(shares);
IERC20(superPool).transfer(DEAD_ADDRESS, shares);
```

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, transfer the asset balance in the constructor of the `SuperPool` contract.
