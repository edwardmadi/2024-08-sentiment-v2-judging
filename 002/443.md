# Exploiter can always bypass `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` and always seize all collateral

### Summary

Protocol integrates [LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L33) variable, which will be hardcoded to 10% regarding the [README](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/349). This means that when a user is liquidatable, the party which is repaying his debt can seize maximum collateral valued 110% of the value of the debt. 
Example:
If we have a liquidatable debt, which is worth $1000 and we have $1500 collateral against it, the liquidator can get at most $1100 collateral if he repays all $1000 debt.
The following is validated by [_validateSeizedAssetValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L129-L160) function.
A vulnerability, which combines providing the same debt to be repaid and `if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position)` can lead to user manipulating `_validateSeizedAssetValue` to believe user is repaying larger amount, which result in the ability to seize any amount of collateral by the liquidator.

### Root Cause

The root cause is a combination of a few things:
- possibility for the liquidator to provide the same loan in `debtData` to `liquidate` function
- The way `type(uint256).max` passed as `amt` is treated

If we take a look into how `_validateSeizedAssetValue` calculate `debtRepaidValue`, we can see that if `type(uint256).max` is passed, we call `pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position)`:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < debtLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = debtData[i].poolId;
            uint256 amt = debtData[i].amt;
            if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position);
            address poolAsset = pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId);
            IOracle oracle = IOracle(riskEngine.getOracleFor(poolAsset));
            debtRepaidValue += oracle.getValueInEth(poolAsset, amt);
        }

```
We do the following for each element inside `debtData`. If we two items in `debtData` with the same pool id and  `type(uint256).max`, function will calculate `debtRepaidValue` to be X2 the value of the debt.
Later in the `liquidate` flow when we [repay the debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L484-L500), we repeat the approach with `type(uint256).max` value:
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < debtDataLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = debtData[i].poolId;
            address poolAsset = pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId);
            uint256 amt = debtData[i].amt;
            if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position);
            // transfer debt asset from the liquidator to the pool
            IERC20(poolAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pool), amt);
            // trigger pool repayment which assumes successful transfer of repaid assets
            pool.repay(poolId, position, amt);
            // update position to reflect repayment of debt by liquidator
            Position(payable(position)).repay(poolId, amt);
        }
```
But this time the behavior is different, because after we call `pool.repay(poolId, position, amt);` - `pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position)` for the same pool will return different data (smaller value). 
So the result is that we have tricked `_validateSeizedAssetValue` to think we are repaying X2 debt, while in `_repayPositionDebt` we will dynamically modify the amount paid based on the remaining debt.
This can be exploited by the liquidator to seize any amount of collateral he wants. By doing so he directly steal the funds from borrower's position, which should be restricted by the system.
**NOTE** that above description is used to easily demonstrate the main cause. In reality the expoiter should provide only the last `debtData` with `type(uint256).max`. The first should be `position's debt - 1` if there is no `minDebt` and `position's debt - minDebt` if there is, because of the following check inside `Pool#repay`:
```solidity
        uint256 borrowShares = _convertToShares(amt, pool.totalBorrowAssets, pool.totalBorrowShares, Math.Rounding.Down);

        // revert if the repaid amt is too small
        if (borrowShares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroSharesRepay(poolId, amt);
```


### Internal pre-conditions

- Having a liquidatable position 
- Loan position should be over 110% collateralized, so we can bypass 10% discount limitation

### External pre-conditions

No

### Attack Path

Imagine the following situation:
For simplicity we assume 1:1 borrowAsset:borrowShare ratio and `minDebt = 0, but vulnerability always exists 

The victim has a position for an asset with collateral, which ltv is 50%
loan = $1000; collateral = $1500

1. Collateral drops to $1400, but the liquidator can get only 1100, because of the liquidation discount
2. Exploiter is able to call liquidate providing [ {loan, $999}, {loan, uint256.max} ] as `DebtData` and collateral asset with $1400 for the amount
3. We will enter `validateLiquidation` -> `_validateSeizedAssetValue`. On each iteration of the debt data entries:
- For {loan, $999} we add $999 to `debtRepaidValue`
- For {loan, uint256.max} we add $1000 to `debtRepaidValue`, because of this line: `if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position);`
- This results in a valid seized amount, because `assetSeizedValue = $1400`, while `maxSeizedAssetValue = 1999 * 1 / 0.9 = $2221`
4. `_transferAssetsToLiquidator` will transfer all $1400 collateral to the liquidator
5. inside `_repayPositionDebt` here is what happens on the iterations:
- For {loan, $999} we repay $999 shares of the borrow position, leaving only $1 borrow share
- For {loan, uint256.max} we will adjust the amt to $1, because `pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position)` will now return the updated position, which we have repaid on the previous iteration. And here we replay the remaining $1 share of debt
Transaction finishes successfully with the incentive for the exploiter much larger than the amount allowed by the protocol



### Impact

The exploit can be used to always steal all collateral of the user, no matter it's price ratio to the debt (We can repay $1000 and seize $2000 if the position is liquidatable)

- Break core protocol invariant/functionality
- Theft of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The best way to mitigate this, without restricting `debtData` to contain only unique entries is to make `debtData` memory variable and modify the `amt` inside `_validateSeizedAssetValue`, so when we enter `_repayPositionDebt` we will always use amounts calculated inside `_validateSeizedAssetValue`.
