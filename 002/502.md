# PoolOwners & Depositors hesitate to participate in the protocol as they may suffer a complete loss of funds when a badDebt Occurs.

## Summary
When a badDebt Occurs the owner can execute `liquidateBadDebt()` which will transfer the remaining collateralAssets that position holds to the owner of the contract.As a result the BasePool owners and the depositors will suffer a complete loss of funds since there is no functionality for the poolOwners to reclaim atleast a some percentage of the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

THere is  no fucntionality to reclaim the remaining collateral directly from the position holder/from the owner of the contract,  since all the collected  assets will go to the owner of the contract.
