# Unauthorized position creation leading to mapping pollution and security risks

## Summary

The PositionManager contract's `_process function` lacks restrictions on who can create new positions. While the `_process` function includes checks to ensure that `msg.sender` is authorized for most operations, this check is bypassed during the creation of new positions. This oversight allows unauthorized users to create positions for any address, leading to mapping pollution. The `ownerOf` and `isAuth` mappings can become cluttered with redundant entries, consuming blockchain storage and increasing gas costs. This vulnerability complicates the management and auditing of legitimate positions. The resulting inefficiencies can degrade contract performance and increase operational complexity.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `PositionManager._process()` when `action.op == Operation.NewPosition`  new position is created. The address of the new position is an arbitrary data send by the caller and no checks are performed for this position address, meaning that any data can be send for address, allowing :

1. Mapping Pollution: The `ownerOf` and `isAuth` mappings can be filled with unnecessary entries, consuming blockchain storage and increasing gas costs. This pollution can degrade the contract's performance and make it difficult to manage legitimate positions.

2. Resource Drain: Excessive creation of positions consumes blockchain resources, potentially leading to network congestion and higher transaction fees for all users.

## Impact

The described vulnerability can have multiple impacts to the protocol:

1. Increased storage costs and gas fees due to mapping pollution.
2. Difficulty in managing and auditing legitimate positions.
3. Degradation of contract performance and increased operational complexity.

        address owner = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        bytes32 salt = bytes32(data[20:52]);


        // hash salt with owner to mitigate positions being frontrun
        salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, salt));
        // create2 a new position as a beacon proxy
        address position = address(new BeaconProxy{ salt: salt }(positionBeacon, ""));
        // update position owner
        ownerOf[position] = owner;
        // owner is authzd by default
        isAuth[position][owner] = true;
        // revert if predicted position address does not match deployed address
        if (position != predictedAddress) revert PositionManager_PredictedPositionMismatch(position, predictedAddress);
        emit PositionDeployed(position, msg.sender, owner);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the caller who is willing to open a new position will be the intended owner of it before allowing its creation.
