# `Pool` contract doesn't strictly follow EIP6909

## Summary
`Pool` contract doesn't strictly follow EIP6909
## Vulnerability Detail
As noted in the contest README, the `Pool` contract should strictly follow EIP6909. As seen in the ERC-6909 standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909#events), the `Transfer` event should have the following parameters:
>  inputs:
    - name: caller
      indexed: false
      type: address
    - name: sender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: receiver
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: id
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: amount
      indexed: false
      type: uint256

Let's take a look at the `Transfer` event in `ERC6909`:
```solidity
event Transfer(address caller, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed id, uint256 amount);
```
As seen the second and third parameters in the standard are `sender` and `receiver`. However, in the `ERC6909` contract, they are `from` and `to`. As the `Pool` contract should strictly follow the EIP6909 standard, this is a medium severity issue.
