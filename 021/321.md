# Lack of Support for fee-on-transfer tokens e.g USDT, USDC

## Summary
Code does not account for the fee-on-transfer if pools are initialized with USDT or USDC
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the `Readme`, the protocol intends to integrate USDT and USDC tokens,
> Tokens are whitelisted, only tokens with valid oracles can be used to create Base Pools.
> Protocol governance will ensure that oracles are only set for standard ERC-20 tokens (plus USDC/USDT)

`USDC` and `USDT` are fee-on-transfer tokens but the code fails to account for these discrepancies in accounting as tokens are deposited, withdrawn, borrowed, or repaid e.g `Pool.sol`, pool initialized with USDT, shares are issued to the depositor not according to the actual assets sent to the pool, which are less than the amount transfer but the parameter provided in the function
```javascript
    function deposit(uint256 poolId, uint256 assets, address receiver) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];

        if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);

        // update state to accrue interest since the last time accrue() was called
        accrue(pool, poolId);

        // Need to transfer before or ERC777s could reenter, or bypass the pool cap
@>        IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        if (pool.totalDepositAssets + assets > pool.poolCap) revert Pool_PoolCapExceeded(poolId);

@>       shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroSharesDeposit(poolId, assets);

        pool.totalDepositAssets += assets;
        pool.totalDepositShares += shares;

        _mint(receiver, poolId, shares);

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    }

```
for the withdraw function depositor will recieve less than their shares burned 

```javascript
    function withdraw(
        uint256 poolId,
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];

        // update state to accrue interest since the last time accrue() was called
        accrue(pool, poolId);

@>        shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Up);
        // check for rounding error since convertToShares rounds down
        if (shares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroShareRedeem(poolId, assets);

        if (msg.sender != owner && !isOperator[owner][msg.sender]) {
            uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender][poolId];
            if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[owner][msg.sender][poolId] = allowed - shares;
        }

        uint256 maxWithdrawAssets = pool.totalDepositAssets - pool.totalBorrowAssets;
        uint256 totalBalance = IERC20(pool.asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        maxWithdrawAssets = (totalBalance > maxWithdrawAssets) ? maxWithdrawAssets : totalBalance;
        if (maxWithdrawAssets < assets) revert Pool_InsufficientWithdrawLiquidity(poolId, maxWithdrawAssets, assets);

        pool.totalDepositAssets -= assets;
        pool.totalDepositShares -= shares;

@>        _burn(owner, poolId, shares);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);

@>        IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
    }
```
Same error prone accounting is done in `SuperPool`, `PositionManager` contracts


if the token incurs a fee on transfer, the actually transferred amount will be less than the provided parameter amount and the deposits will have a wrong state value. As Users withdraw their tokens the latter users will receive less than what they submitted and in some cases, withdrawals can revert or protocol can reach insolvency. 
## Impact
1.  loss of funds for users
2.  Protocol can become insolvent

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Recommend implementing a measure like transferSupportingFeeOnTransfer function that can correctly handle these transfers. 
3. A sweep function can also be created to help with positive rebases and airdrops.
