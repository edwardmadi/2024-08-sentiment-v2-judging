# liquidators will have no incentive to liquidate small borrow positions

## Summary
Small borrow positions will not be liquidatable due to lack of profit incentive

## Vulnerability Detail
`Pool::borrow` uses two parameters `minDebt`, `minBorrow` to check that if loan being borrowed is below the threshold, the transaction will revert. But according to the `Readme` of the contest these parameters will intially be set to zero 
`Min Debt = from 0 to 0.05 ETH = from 0 to 50000000000000000` & `Min Borrow = from 0 to 0.05 ETH = from 0 to 50000000000000000`
So positions can borrow any amount without any lower limit cap, this can lead to lack of incentive for liquidators. 

1. A position borrows an small amount
2. But after sometime, it becomes liquidatable
3. As depicted in `PoolManager::_transferAssetsToLiquidator` function that an `liquidationFee` is deducted from the assets transferred to the liquidator. `Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);`
4. So after the deduction of this fixed fee, there might be enough profit margin left for the liquidator to liquidate the fee as liquidator still has to `pay gas` for the transaction
## Impact
leaves the protocol with bad debt and can even cause the protocol to go underwater.

## Recommendation
Avoid setting `minBorrow` & `minDebt` to 0
