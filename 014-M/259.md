# `ChainlinkEthOracle` and `ChainlinkUsdOracle` did not check `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`, this may cause wrong price

### Summary

`ChainlinkEthOracle` and `ChainlinkUsdOracle` did not check `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`, this may cause wrong price as return value of feeds that requested. This can happen if any condition which can make the price extremely low or high outside the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` price limits or there are assets such as `USDC/ETH` that require this check.

### Root Cause

1. In [ChainlinkEthOracle::_getPriceWithSanityChecks()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkEthOracle.sol#L99-L104) there is a missing check `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`
2. In [ChainlinkUsdOracle::_getPriceWithSanityChecks()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkUsdOracle.sol#L114-L120) there is a missing check `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer`

Although the function has a check price `<= 0` then it will revert, but this cannot handle several different cases. For example, token A has a `minAnswer` of `$2` and there is a situation that makes the token price become `$1.5`, the price from the oracle will remain `$2` because that is the `minAnswer` of token A. In addition, there is a `USDC/ETH` pair whose price must be maintained in the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` range

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

There are events that can cause prices to fall drastically or rise drastically (i.e LUNA crash) and price above 0. But for assets that need to be checked, such as `USDC/ETH`, this must be done because its range price.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The real impact for the protocol is cause incorrect price conversion calculations for assets that use both of these oracles and affect all functions on the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`ChainlinkEthOracle` and `ChainlinkUsdOracle` should check the returned answer against the `minPrice` / `maxPrice` and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

```solidity
if (answer >= maxPrice or answer <= minPrice) revert();
```
