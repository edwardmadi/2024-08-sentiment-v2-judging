# Did not approve to zero first

## Summary
Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.


## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.
The following attempt to call the approve() function without setting the allowance to zero first.


```solidity

 if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }

```
However, if the token involved is an ERC20 token that does not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value, it will break a number of key functions or features of the protocol.
## Impact
The function `reallocate()` will not work if the `approve` function reverts.
