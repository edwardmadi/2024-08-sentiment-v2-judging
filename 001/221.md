# Inconsistent Cap Enforcement in `reallocate` and `_supplyToPools` Functions of `SuperPool`

## Summary

There is an inconsistency in the enforcement of the deposit caps in the `reallocate` and `_supplyToPools` functions within the `SuperPool` contract. This disparity can lead to scenarios where deposits are either incorrectly rejected or inadvertently accepted beyond the cap limit, causing unexpected asset management issues.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. **Current Logic in `reallocate` Function**:
    - The function checks if the sum of `assetsInPool` and `deposits[i].assets` is less than `poolCap`, which unintentionally excludes the scenario where the sum equals `poolCap`.

    ```solidity
    if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
    ```

2. **Current Logic in `_supplyToPools` Function**:
    - The function correctly allows depositing as long as `assetsInPool` is less than `poolCapFor[poolId]`, meaning the total after deposit can be exactly `poolCapFor[poolId]`.

    ```solidity
    if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
        uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool;
    ```

This inconsistency can lead to confusion in the cap enforcement, causing behavioral discrepancies during deposits.

## Impact

- **Behavioral Inconsistency**: Different handling of the pool cap between `reallocate` and `_supplyToPools` functions can result in:
  - Erroneous rejection of valid deposits that meet the cap exactly.
  - Unintended acceptance of deposits that exceed the cap due to inconsistent checks.

This impacts the reliability and predictability of asset management within the `SuperPool` contract, potentially leading to financial discrepancies.

1. **Current `reallocate` Function**:
  ```solidity
  function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
      if (!isAllocator[msg.sender] && msg.sender != Ownable.owner()) {
          revert SuperPool_OnlyAllocatorOrOwner(address(this), msg.sender);
      }

      uint256 withdrawsLength = withdraws.length;
      for (uint256 i; i < withdrawsLength; ++i) {
          if (poolCapFor[withdraws[i].poolId] == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(withdraws[i].poolId);
          POOL.withdraw(withdraws[i].poolId, withdraws[i].assets, address(this), address(this));
      }

      uint256 depositsLength = deposits.length;
      for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
          uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
          // disallow deposits to pool not associated with this SuperPool
          if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
          // respect pool cap
          uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
449:            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
              ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
              POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
          }
      }
  }
  ```

2. **Current `_supplyToPools` Function**:

  ```solidity
530:            if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
531:                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool;
              if (assets < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = assets;
              ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

              // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
              try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                  assets -= supplyAmt;
              } catch { }

              if (assets == 0) return;
          }
  ```

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the condition to allow `assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets` to be equal to `poolCap`.

  ```diff
  function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
      if (!isAllocator[msg.sender] && msg.sender != Ownable.owner()) {
          revert SuperPool_OnlyAllocatorOrOwner(address(this), msg.sender);
      }

      uint256 withdrawsLength = withdraws.length;
      for (uint256 i; i < withdrawsLength; ++i) {
          if (poolCapFor[withdraws[i].poolId] == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(withdraws[i].poolId);
          POOL.withdraw(withdraws[i].poolId, withdraws[i].assets, address(this), address(this));
      }

      uint256 depositsLength = deposits.length;
      for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
          uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
          // disallow deposits to pool not associated with this SuperPool
          if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
          // respect pool cap
          uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
-            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
+            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets <= poolCap) {
              ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
              POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
          }
      }
  }
  ```
