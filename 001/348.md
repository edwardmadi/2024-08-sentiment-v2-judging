# In Superpool, fee is not taken from depositor/minter/redeemer/withdrawer, but from the whole pool.

## Summary

In Superpool, fee is not taken from depositor/minter/redeemer/withdrawer, but from the whole pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take the `deposit` function as an example:
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```
```solidity
    function accrue() public {
        (uint256 feeShares, uint256 newTotalAssets) = simulateAccrue();
        if (feeShares != 0) ERC20._mint(feeRecipient, feeShares);
        lastTotalAssets = newTotalAssets;
    }
```
```solidity
    function simulateAccrue() internal view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 newTotalAssets = totalAssets();
        uint256 interestAccrued = (newTotalAssets > lastTotalAssets) ? newTotalAssets - lastTotalAssets : 0;
        if (interestAccrued == 0 || fee == 0) return (0, newTotalAssets);

        uint256 feeAssets = interestAccrued.mulDiv(fee, WAD);
        // newTotalAssets already includes feeAssets
        uint256 feeShares = _convertToShares(feeAssets, newTotalAssets - feeAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);

        return (feeShares, newTotalAssets);
    }
```
`feeAssets` is determined by the difference caused by the operation performed by the user, but this fee is not deducted from the shares received by the user. This means that all users of the entire protocol share the fee.

An attacker can repeatedly deposit-withdraw very large amounts of assets to make the asset/share ratio keep decreasing.

## Impact

Attacker can decrease asset/share ratio at a low cost, causing other users to suffer significant losses.

## Recommendation

Fees should be deducted from the specific operator.
