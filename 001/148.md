# Incorrect Interest Accrual Can Lead to Asset Overvaluation and Share Mispricing

## Summary

The accrue function in the Pool contract incorrectly updates totalDepositAssets by adding the full interestAccrued amount instead of the net interest after deducting fees. This leads to an overestimation of the pool's total assets, affecting share price calculations for deposits and withdrawals.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the accrue function, totalDepositAssets is updated as follows:

`pool.totalDepositAssets += interestAccrued;`

However, this includes the portion of interest that is allocated to fees (feeAssets). The correct update should only add the net interest to totalDepositAssets:

pool.totalDepositAssets += (interestAccrued - feeAssets);

This discrepancy causes an overestimation of totalDepositAssets over time, leading to incorrect share price calculations in both deposit and withdraw functions.

## Impact

In the deposit function, user receive fewer shares than they should for their deposit.

Here is an example; 

Initial state: 

totalDepositAssets = 10,000
totalDepositShares  = 10,000
interestAccrued = 1,000
interestFee = 20% (0.2 in decimal)

Case 1: Current implementation

function calling accrue():

feeAssets = 1,000 * 0.2 = 200
feeShares = 200 * 10,000 / 10,000 = 200 (assuming 1:1 ratio for simplicity)

totalDepositShares = 10,000 + 200 = 10,200 
totalDepositAssets  = 10,000 + 1,000 = 11,000 

then the next line; 

Ali deposits 1,000 assets:

shares = _convertToShares(1000, 11000, 10200, Math.Rounding.Down)
       = (1000 * 10200) / 11000 ≈ 927 (rounded down)

shares = 927

Case 2: Proposed solution: 

accrue():

totalDepositAssets should be 10,800 (10,000 + 1,000 - 200)

shares = _convertToShares(1000, 10800, 10200, Math.Rounding.Down)
       = (1000 * 10200) / 10800 ≈ 944 (rounded down)

shares = 944

Ali receive 927 shares instead of 944

This demonstrate how Ali will end up with receive fewer shares than he should with the current implementation. 

----------

In the Withdraw function, Users are able to withdraw more assets per share than they should.

Here is an example(using the details above); 

Case 1: Current implementation

Ali tries to withdraws 1,000 assets:

shares = _convertToShares(1000, 11000, 10200, Math.Rounding.Up)
       = (1000 * 10200) / 11000 ≈ 928 (rounded up)

shares = 928

Case 2: Proposed solution

totalDepositAssets should be 10,800 (10,000 + 1,000 - 200)

shares = _convertToShares(1000, 10800, 10200, Math.Rounding.Up)
       = (1000 * 10200) / 10800 ≈ 945 (rounded up)

shares  = 945


In this case, Ali will only burn 928 shares instead of 945 shares to withdraw 1,000 assets. 

This demonstrates how Ali can withdraw more assets per share than he should, effectively overvaluing his shares during withdrawal and depleting the pool faster

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the simulateAccrue function to return `feeAssets`

```diff

function simulateAccrue(PoolData storage pool) internal view returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
    // ... existing code ...

+    return (interestAccrued, feeShares, feeAssets);  // Changed: now returning feeAssets as well
}

```

Then make use of the `feeAsset` in the accrue function to correctly update totalDepositAssets by only adding the net interest after deducting fees:

```diff

function accrue(PoolData storage pool, uint256 id) internal {
+    (uint256 interestAccrued, uint256 feeShares, uint256 feeAssets) = simulateAccrue(pool);  // Changed: now receiving feeAssets

    // ... existing code ...

+  pool.totalDepositAssets += (interestAccrued - feeAssets);  // Changed: using feeAssets directly
    
    // ... rest of the function ...
}

```
