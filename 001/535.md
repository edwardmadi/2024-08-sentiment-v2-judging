# The `SuperPool.reallocate()` function uses `approve` instead of `forceApprove`, which could lead to a revert

## Summary

For `USDT`, the `approve` action will revert if it attempts to change the approved amount from one non-zero value to another non-zero value. The `forceApprove` method prevents this issue, allowing the approved amount to be changed between non-zero values. If the `SuperPool` uses `USDT`, reallocations could revert because it employs `approve` instead of `forceApprove`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the case where the `SuperPool` uses `USDT` as its `ASSET`. In the `reallocate()` function, it approves the necessary assets to the `POOL`, as seen at `L450`. The issue is that it uses `approve` instead of `forceApprove`, which will revert if the `POOL` has already been approved for some amount of assets.

```solidity
    function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
        ...
450             ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
        ...
```

It is possible that the `POOL` already has an approved amount. Consider the following scenario:

1. The last `poolId` in the `depositQueue` of the `SuperPool` is currently paused.
2. Alice deposits into the `SuperPool`, triggering the `_supplyToPools()` function to allocate her assets:
    - At the final loop, the function attempts to deposit into the last `poolId`.
        - It approves Alice's assets for the `POOL` (see `L533`).
        - It then tries to deposit into the last `poolId` (see `L536`), but this fails because the last `poolId` is paused. Since a `try/catch` mechanism is employed, this failure does not revert the entire transaction, leaving the approved amount for the `POOL` unchanged.

As a result, future reallocations become impossible, as the `POOL` has already been approved an amount.

```solidity
    function _supplyToPools(uint256 assets) internal {
        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = depositQueue[i];
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));

            if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool;
                if (assets < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = assets;
533             ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

                // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
536             try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                    assets -= supplyAmt;
                } catch { }

                if (assets == 0) return;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact

Reallocating could revert due to previously approved amounts.

## Recommendation

Use `forceApprove` instead of `approve`.

```diff
    function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
        ...
-               ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
+               ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
        ...
```
