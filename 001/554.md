# `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` can overestimate maximum the available liquidity, resulting in a lack of ERC4626 complianace

## Summary

`SuperPool::maxWithdraw()` and `SuperPool::maxRedeem()` make internal calls to `_maxWithdraw()`. This function considers the available liquidity of all base pools in the deposit queue and the available asset balance on the SuperPool contract, but does not consider the amount of assets owned by the SuperPool in each underlying pool. 
As a result, there are states where `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` will return a value which would cause a revert if `withdraw()` or `redeem()` were called with the reported max values in the same transaction. This breaks ERC4626 compliance.

## Vulnerability Detail

For full [ERC4626 compliance](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), `maxWithdraw()`:

>"MUST return the maximum amount of assets that could be transferred from owner through withdraw and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary)."

And `maxRedeem()`:

>"MUST return the maximum amount of shares that could be transferred from owner through redeem and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary)."

However, both `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` make an internal call to `_maxWithdraw()`. As shown below, this function sums the available liquidity in all pools in the deposit queue and the assets available on the SuperPool contract. However this liquidity can include liquidity this SuperPool does not have access to thus overreporting the maximum withdrawable value:

```javascript
    function _maxWithdraw(address _owner, uint256 _totalAssets, uint256 _totalShares) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalLiquidity; // max assets that can be withdrawn based on superpool and underlying pool liquidity
        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
@>          totalLiquidity += POOL.getLiquidityOf(depositQueue[i]); // @audit this includes liquidity we cannot withdraw
        }
        totalLiquidity += ASSET.balanceOf(address(this)); // unallocated assets in the superpool

        // return the minimum of totalLiquidity and _owner balance
        uint256 userAssets = _convertToAssets(ERC20.balanceOf(_owner), _totalAssets, _totalShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
        return totalLiquidity > userAssets ? userAssets : totalLiquidity;
    }
```

## Impact

- Lack of ERC4626 complaiance
- Internal/external contract integrations expect `maxWithdraw()` and `maxRedeem()` to return a value that would not revert if used in the corresponding functions.


## POC

1. A SuperPool has Base Pools A and B in the `depositQueue` and a single depositor (user1) holding all shares
2. For this SuperPool, the call `Pool::getAssetsOf()` reveals:
  -  Pool A: 10e18 assets 
  -  Pool B: 1e18 assets
3. Calls to `getLiquidityOf()` for Pool A reveals:
  - Pool A: 1e18 liquidity 
  - Pool B: 10e18 liqudity
4. The SuperPool has no latent `ASSET` balance
5. User1 calls `maxWithdraw()` which returns 11e18.
6. User1 calls `Withdraw()` attempting to withdraw 11e18 which reverts as it attempts to transfer user1 more assets than is available.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The true maximum withdrawable liquidity from each underlying pool is the minimum of the `assetsInPool` and `poolLiquidity`, similar to the flow in `SuperPool::__withdrawFromPools`:

```diff
    function _maxWithdraw(address _owner, uint256 _totalAssets, uint256 _totalShares) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalLiquidity; // max assets that can be withdrawn based on superpool and underlying pool liquidity
        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
-           totalLiquidity += POOL.getLiquidityOf(depositQueue[i]);
+           uint256 poolId = depositQueue[i];
+           uint256 poolLiquidity = POOL.getLiquidityOf(poolId);
+           uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));
+           totalLiquidity += (poolLiquidity > assetsInPool) ? assetsInPool : poolLiquidity // Cumulatively add the minimum of assetsInPool and poolLiquidity
        }
        totalLiquidity += ASSET.balanceOf(address(this)); // unallocated assets in the superpool

        // return the minimum of totalLiquidity and _owner balance
        uint256 userAssets = _convertToAssets(ERC20.balanceOf(_owner), _totalAssets, _totalShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
        return totalLiquidity > userAssets ? userAssets : totalLiquidity;
    }
```
