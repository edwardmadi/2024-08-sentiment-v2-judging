# SuperPool doesn't supply contract funds to Pool when a new Pool is added

### Summary

If there are no pools or existing Pool limit is reached the `deposit()` will keep the funds in the `SuperPool.sol` contract. Now, if a new Pool is added or Pool limit increases the `deposit()` doesn't consider the existing contract balance while depositing to `Pool`. It only deposits the newly deposited asset in that particular call. The existing balance in the `SuperPool.sol` will remain unutilized even though a new Pool has been added or the existing Pool size has been increased.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L497-L506` The `_deposit()` only considers the asset received in the current call and not also the contract balance.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin creates a Super Pool
2. Alice deposits 90 USDC in the Super Pool.
3. Admin adds a Pool.
4. Bob deposits 10 USDC which will be supplied to underlying Pool.
5. Now Alice and Bob will earn interest for only 10 USDC deposited and 90 USDC in Super Pool are unutilized.

### Impact

1. The Pool will have less liquidity to provide to the borrowers. 
2. The Super Pool will have assets in Idle state not earning any interest on deposits.

### PoC

### Testcase
Add the following testcase in `Superpool.t.sol`
```solidity
function testSimpleDepositIntoSuperpool() public {
    vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user);

    asset1.mint(user, 100 ether);
    asset1.approve(address(superPool), 100 ether);

    console.log("If no Pool is added to Super Pool the deposit is kept in Super Pool");
    console.log("Balance of Super pool Before Deposit: ", asset1.balanceOf(address(superPool)));

    uint256 expectedShares = superPool.previewDeposit(90 ether);
    uint256 shares = superPool.deposit(90 ether, user);
    assertEq(shares, expectedShares);

    console.log("Balance of Super pool After Deposit: ", asset1.balanceOf(address(superPool)));

    vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
    console.log("Pool is set for Super Pool");
    superPool.addPool(linearRatePool, 100 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(user);

    shares = superPool.deposit(10 ether, user);

    console.log("Balance of Super pool After Deposit: ", asset1.balanceOf(address(superPool)));
    console.log("Balance of Pool After Deposit: ", asset1.balanceOf(address(pool)));

    // assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(pool)), 100 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
### Logs
```Logs
Logs:
  If no Pool is added to Super Pool the deposit is kept in Super Pool
  Balance of Super pool Before Deposit:  100000
  Balance of Super pool After Deposit:  90000000000000100000
  Pool is set for Super Pool
  Balance of Super pool After Deposit:  90000000000000100000
  Balance of Pool After Deposit:  10000000000000000000
```
Alice Deposited 90 USDC to Super Pool when Pool was not added. The Pool is set and Bob Deposited 10 USDC. Now the 10 USDC is sent to the Pool contract while 90 USDC remain in Super Pool and in Idle State.

### Mitigation

Also transfer the balance of Super Pool to the Pool when `deposit()` is called

```solidity
function _deposit(address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal {
    // assume that lastTotalAssets are up to date
    if (lastTotalAssets + assets > superPoolCap) revert SuperPool_SuperPoolCapReached();
    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    ASSET.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
    ERC20._mint(receiver, shares);
@>  _supplyToPools(assets + ASSET.balanceOf(address(this)));
    lastTotalAssets += assets;
    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
}   
```
