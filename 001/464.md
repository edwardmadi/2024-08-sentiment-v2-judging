# reallocate() might work incorrectly sometimes, leaving un-utilized funds in super pool

## Summary
reallocate() might work incorrectly sometimes, leaving un-utilized funds in super pool 
## Vulnerability Detail
There is inconsistency when treating the case where  `assetsInPool + deposit == poolCap`

In SuperPool::deposit(), depositing into the targeted pool is still allowed when this scenario happens:
```solidity
       for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = depositQueue[i];
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));

            if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool; //@audit - this shows that assetsInPool + deposit == poolCap is ok to proceed
                if (assets < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = assets;
                ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

                // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
                try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                    assets -= supplyAmt;
                } catch { }

                if (assets == 0) return; 
            }
        }
```
Meanwhile in SuperPool:reallocate(), depositing into the targeted pool will be skipped:
```solidity
 for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
            // disallow deposits to pool not associated with this SuperPool
            if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
            // respect pool cap
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) { //@audit - will skip when  assetsInPool + deposit == poolCap
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
```
## Impact
In the case where assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets == poolCap, reallocate() will ignore depositing in that pool, leaving funds in super pool contract.

## Recommendation
Consider allowing to deposit when `assetsInPool + deposit == poolCap`:
```solidity
     >>>  if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets <= poolCap) { 
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
```
