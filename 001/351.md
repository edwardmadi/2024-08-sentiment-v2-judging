# `deploySuperPool` will revert if the asset is USDT

### Summary

USDT's approve function does not return a bool, therefore it is not compliant with the IERC20 interface.

Therefore the following [call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPoolFactory.sol#L73) in `deploySuperPool` will always revert when the `asset` is USDT because it will not return a bool like the `IERC20` interface is expecting.

```solidity
IERC20(asset).approve(address(superPool), initialDepositAmt);
```

### Root Cause

USDT's approve function does not return a bool

Therefore the following [call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPoolFactory.sol#L73) in `deploySuperPool` will always revert when the `asset` is USDT because it will not return a bool like the `IERC20` interface is expecting.

The interface will attempt to decode the return data as a bool and this will revert. 

```solidity
IERC20(asset).approve(address(superPool), initialDepositAmt);
```
