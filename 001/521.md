# The `convertToAssets()` function is not ERC 4626 compliant

### Summary

[ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) clearly states the following about the `convertToAssets()` function:

>MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.

Defined in the [EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626), 'fee' refers to "An amount of assets or shares charged to the user by the Vault. Fees can exists for deposits, yield, AUM, withdrawals, or anything else prescribed by the Vault."

In this protocol, there is a fee charged on interest, which is yield of the lenders. Hence, the above definition of fee refers to the interest fee in the super pools. 

The issue is that the protocol's [implementation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L202) of the function is clearly inclusive of the interest fee that is calculated through `simulateAccrue()`.

```solidity
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        (uint256 feeShares, uint256 newTotalAssets) = simulateAccrue();
        return _convertToAssets(shares, newTotalAssets, totalSupply() + feeShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```

### Root Cause

`convertToAssets()` is inclusive of the interest fee, since `feeShares` is added to `totalSupply()`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

SuperPool is not ERC-4626 compliant, this can pose issues with external integrations that expect strict compliance

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that `convertToAssets()` function is not inclusive of the interest fee
