# Reallocations will often fail upon using USDT

## Summary
Reallocations will often fail upon using USDT
## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned in the contest README, USDT will be an allowed token. Reallocators can reallocate tokens to different pools using `SuperPool::reallocate()`, here is the part responsible for the deposits in the new pools:
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
            // disallow deposits to pool not associated with this SuperPool
            if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
            // respect pool cap
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
```
There, we have these 2 lines:
```solidity
ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
```
As seen, we use the `approve()` function which when used with USDT, will cause a revert if we are approving from a non-0 to a non-0 value. Just looking at that, this is fine as that amount is then being deposited into the pool, thus the approval gets used up. The issue is that upon depositing, we call `_supplyToPools()` which deposits tokens into pools. There, we have this code:
```solidity
ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);
try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
      assets -= supplyAmt;
} catch { }
```
As seen, we approve the asset and then try to deposit into the pool. As the deposit can revert for numerous reasons and we do not want to stop the whole execution, we use a `try/catch` block. However, upon a revert, the approval will stay to the set `supplyAmt`. Then, in the scenario I mentioned above, we will be approving from a non-0 to a non-0 amount causing a revert.
## Impact
Reallocations will often fail upon using USDT

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `forceApprove` in the other scenario as well or after the `try/catch` block, make sure that the approval is 0
