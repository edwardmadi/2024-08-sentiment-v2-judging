# reallocate() may be dos because of improper approve in USDT

## Summary
When the owner reallocate the pool, the contract should grant approval to `POOL`. Normal approve() for USDT token may be reverted if current allowance is not zero. This will cause reallocate() reverted.

## Vulnerability Detail
In reallocate, we can rearrange the funds via withdraw from some pools and deposit into some other pools.
When we try to deposit into some pools, we need to grant approval to this `POOL`. The problem is that we use one normal approve() not one forceApprove(), this will cause approve() reverted if `ASSET` is USDT and current allowance is not zero.
The vulnerability will occur based on two conditions:
1. `ASSET`'s approve() will be reverted if the allowance is not zero.  
   - From readme, our sponsor mentions that `Protocol governance will ensure that oracles are only set for standard ERC-20 tokens (plus USDC/USDT)`. So USDT is one mandatory token for sentiment. 
2. The current allowance[address(this)][`POOL`] may be larger than 0 before we trigger `ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);`
    - When we try to deposit via superpool, `_supplyToPools` function will be triggered. In `_supplyToPools()`, we will grant approval to `POOL`, and this allowance may not be reduced to zero if `POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this))` is reverted because the `poolId` is paused or deposit amount exceed `poolId`'s cap. In this case, the deposit transaction will succeed and the allowance is set and not used.

```solidity
    function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
        ...
        uint256 depositsLength = deposits.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
            ...
            // respect pool cap
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
                // @audit should use forceApprove
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
    }
```
```solidity
    function _supplyToPools(uint256 assets) internal {
        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = depositQueue[i];
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));

            if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool;
                if (assets < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = assets;
                ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

                // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
                // If one pool is pause, this may be reverted, we skip this pool and continue next one to prevent the dos.
@>               try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                    assets -= supplyAmt;
                } catch { }

                if (assets == 0) return;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
The `reallocate()` may be dos when `ASSET` is USDT.

## Recommendation
Use forceApprove() to replace approve() in reallocate().
