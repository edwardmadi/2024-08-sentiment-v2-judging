# Deployment of superPools with certain accepted assets will fail

## Summary
USDT is an allowed asset in the Sentiment protocol that may be used to create superPools, however approval of USDT to `initialAmount` will fail here

```solidity
IERC20(asset).approve(address(superPool), initialDepositAmt); //@audit <= use forceApprove.
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether USDT `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Impact
Users will not be able to deploy superPools with USDT as the pool asset because approval to `initialAmount` before approving to 0 will revert

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`forceApprove` is used everywhere in the code except here, I would recommend adding it everywhere.
