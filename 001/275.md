# A smaller amount of funds can be reallocated to a pool because of a wrong check

## Summary
A smaller amount of funds can be reallocated to a pool because of a wrong check
## Vulnerability Detail
Funds can be reallocated to a different pool. First, we get the funds from one pool and then we deposit them into another one. This is the loop responsible for the second part:
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
            // disallow deposits to pool not associated with this SuperPool
            if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
            // respect pool cap
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
```
As seen, we will only deposit into a pool if the assets in the pool after the deposit will be less than the pool cap. However, the check should actually be `<=` instead of `<` as a pool should hold an amount equal to the pool cap, not less than it.
