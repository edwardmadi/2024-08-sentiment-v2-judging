# Superpool contract doesn't strictly follow EIP4626

## Summary
Superpool contract doesn't strictly follow EIP4626

## Vulnerability Detail
As seen in the contest README, the Superpool contract must strictly follow EIP4626. Here is what we can see about the implementation of `maxDeposit()` for the EIP4626 standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626):
>MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if deposits are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

We can see that the contract has the functionality to be paused:
```solidity
function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```

However, as we can see in the `maxDeposit()` function, that is not factored in:
```solidity
    function maxDeposit(address) public view returns (uint256) {
        return _maxDeposit(totalAssets());
    }
```
