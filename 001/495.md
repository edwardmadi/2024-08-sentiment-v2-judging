# SuperPool isn't fully compliant with ERC 4626

## Summary

According to the contest README, it's expected of the SuperPool to be strictly compliant with the EIP 4626 standard:

```solidity
Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?

SuperPool.sol is strictly ERC4626 compliant
Pool.sol is strictly ERC6909 compliant
```

`totalAssets` isn't fully compliant with the requirements outlined in the EIP:

## Vulnerability Detail

As per the EIP 4626 standard, the `totalAssets` method: 

Total amount of the underlying asset that is “managed” by Vault.

SHOULD include any compounding that occurs from yield.

**MUST be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.**

MUST NOT revert.

In this case, the `totalAssets` doesn't include the super pool fees that are "charged" on the interest earned, upon which the totalAssets which are available / can be withdrawn is also dependent on. 

As it can be seen from the `totalAssets()`: 

```solidity

    function totalAssets() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 assets = ASSET.balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
            assets += POOL.getAssetsOf(depositQueue[i], address(this));
        }

        return assets;
    }

```
When `getAssetsOf` is called on the individual pools, this is how the amount of underlying assets is determined: 

```solidity
function getAssetsOf(uint256 poolId, address guy) public view returns (uint256) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];
        (uint256 accruedInterest, uint256 feeShares) = simulateAccrue(pool);
        return _convertToAssets(
            balanceOf[guy][poolId],
            pool.totalDepositAssets + accruedInterest,
            pool.totalDepositShares + feeShares,
            Math.Rounding.Down
        );
    }
```
As we can see from the above, the fee shares are included when calculating the amount of underlying assets, but when `totalAssets()` is called, the fee shares are not included in the calculation, which results in the function showcasing more assets than the amount that can actually be withdrawn from the super pool.

This is because when shares are converted to assets, in case you'd want to redeem all of the existing  shares, it will take the feeShares into consideration as well: 

```solidity
    function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view virtual returns (uint256 assets) {
        (uint256 feeShares, uint256 newTotalAssets) = simulateAccrue();
        return _convertToAssets(shares, newTotalAssets, totalSupply() + feeShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
``` 

This also points to another problem related to the 4626 standard: 

**MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.**

This goes for the `convertToShares` method as well.
