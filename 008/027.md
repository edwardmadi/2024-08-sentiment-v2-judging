# Chainlink min/max price is not validated

## Summary
Chainlink min/max price is not validated, even thought it's required.

## Vulnerability Detail
[_getPriceWithSanityChecks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkUsdOracle.sol#L114-L120) is used by ChainlinkUsdOracle to get the value of any asset in USD. However as we can see from the code bellow this function lacks any checks for min/max price.

```solidity
    function _getPriceWithSanityChecks(address asset) private view returns (uint256) {
        address feed = priceFeedFor[asset];
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IAggegregatorV3(feed).latestRoundData();

        if (price <= 0) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_NonPositivePrice(asset);
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - stalePriceThresholdFor[feed]) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_StalePrice(asset);
        
        return uint256(price);
    }
```
Chainlink aggregators have `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` functions to validate prices from `latestRoundData` and revert transactions if prices fall outside this range. However, these safeguards are currently not used, risking the use of inaccurate prices during sudden market crashes.

To see if feeds are configured, check if they have min/max values. Since the system works with any ERC20 token, you can use many tokens with min/max enabled in pools. Here are a few examples of aggregator feeds with min/max values set up and ready for use in the system:

ETH / BTC  - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3c8F2d5af2e0F5Ef7C23A08DF6Ad168ece071D4b#readContract
ETH / USD - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x3607e46698d218B3a5Cae44bF381475C0a5e2ca7#readContract
SOL / USD - https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8C4308F7cbD7fB829645853cD188500D7dA8610a#readContract

Note that the [docs](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/judging#viii.-list-of-issue-categories-that-are-considered-valid) consider min/max check a valid issue.

> Issues related to minAnswer and maxAnswer checks on Chainlink's Price Feeds are considered medium only if the Watson explicitly mentions the price feeds (e.g. USDC/ETH) that require this check.


## Impact
Pool shares can be mispriced due to missing min/max check.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _getPriceWithSanityChecks(address asset) private view returns (uint256) {
        address feed = priceFeedFor[asset];
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IAggegregatorV3(feed).latestRoundData();

        if (price <= 0) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_NonPositivePrice(asset);
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - stalePriceThresholdFor[feed]) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_StalePrice(asset);
        
        return uint256(price);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Check for min/max price before returning the value.
