# Lenders Can Evade Bad Debt Loss by Front-running `PositionManager::liquidateBadDebt` Calls

## Summary
Malicious lenders can front-run [PositionManager::liquidateBadDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L446-L464) calls to withdraw all their assets from a pool, avoiding losses from bad debt and unfairly shifting those losses to other lenders.
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious lender can front run [PositionManager::liquidateBadDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L446-L464) call to withdraw their entire assets from a pool, if the pool has incurred bad debt.

This allows the lender to receive the benefits of providing liquidity to the pool without incurring any loss whenever bad debts are created. These losses are instead pushed onto the other lenders, making them hence incur more loss than they should.


## Impact
This will allow a lender to unfairly avoid losses from bad debt, leaving other lenders to absorb the full impact, which could lead to significant financial losses for them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making the withdrawals a two-step process:
+ The first step requests a withdrawal and marks the time. 
+ The second request, processes the withdrawal but requires a period to elapse from the first step.
