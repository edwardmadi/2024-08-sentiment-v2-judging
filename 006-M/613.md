# User's monitoring for bad debt can cause severe losses for other users

## Summary
User's monitoring for bad debt can cause severe losses for other users since rebalance debt fully decreases the lost amount without paying any in return

## Vulnerability Detail
In case of bad debt, the debt amount is decrease completely from the depositor balance
```solidity
    function rebalanceBadDebt(uint256 poolId, address position) external {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];
        accrue(pool, poolId);


        // revert if the caller is not the position manager
        if (msg.sender != positionManager) revert Pool_OnlyPositionManager(poolId, msg.sender);


        // compute pool and position debt in shares and assets
        uint256 totalBorrowShares = pool.totalBorrowShares;
        uint256 totalBorrowAssets = pool.totalBorrowAssets;
        uint256 borrowShares = borrowSharesOf[poolId][position];
        // [ROUND] round up against lenders
        uint256 borrowAssets = _convertToAssets(borrowShares, totalBorrowAssets, totalBorrowShares, Math.Rounding.Up);


        // rebalance bad debt across lenders
        pool.totalBorrowShares = totalBorrowShares - borrowShares;
        // handle borrowAssets being rounded up to be greater than totalBorrowAssets
        pool.totalBorrowAssets = (totalBorrowAssets > borrowAssets) ? totalBorrowAssets - borrowAssets : 0;
        uint256 totalDepositAssets = pool.totalDepositAssets;
        pool.totalDepositAssets = (totalDepositAssets > borrowAssets) ? totalDepositAssets - borrowAssets : 0;
        borrowSharesOf[poolId][position] = 0;
    }
```

Since there in queue etc. for withdrawals, user's can monitor for such events and front run the tx to withdraw their assets leaving the last ones to take all the loss

## Impact
Last users loose a significant amount
