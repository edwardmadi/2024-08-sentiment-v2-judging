# The smart contracts will not work on all EVM - compatible networks

## Summary
In the README.md, the sponsor states that this system should work on any evm-compatible chain.

The problem is that it may be impossible to achieve this, for trusted oracle (chainlink/redstones) do not support all l2 evm-compatible chain. 
## Vulnerability Detail
There are some l2 chains that is not supported by neither chainlink nor redstone. For example: FileCoin, PulseChain, etc ...
Redstone doc also states that you might need some custom development to get redstone oracle runs on unfamiliar chains.

## Impact
On some certain networks, the system won't work at all, since there is no chainlink / redstone oracle. Although protocol has fixed price oracle, it should be only used by some very particular assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If the protocol is planning to deploy on any evm-compatible chain, they should contact redstone team to learn more about getting redstone oracle to run on any chain
