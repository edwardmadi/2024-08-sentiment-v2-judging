# Assets gets ineffectual by getting LOCKED in the position contract when the owner makes the asset unknown.

## Summary
In the `transfer()` there is a check for `isKnown[asset]`. This check can deny position owners from redeeming it when the PositionManager contract owner decided to make it `unknown`.
As a result the assets will get locked there without giving any good to the position holder.

## Vulnerability Detail

A position holder deposit an asset A. Later owner decided to make that asset A unknown by calling [`toggleKnownAsset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L522).

Hence , position holder will try to redeem that assets by calling [`transfer()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L307). since that asset is not giving any advantages to the position holder.

But as a result of the below check , the function will revert.

```solidity
if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);
```

The assets will become ineffectual while remaining locked inside the position contract.


## Impact
In the `transfer()` function, there is a check for `isKnown[asset]`. This check can prevent position holders from redeeming the asset if the PositionManager contract owner decides to mark it as `unknown`.As a result, the assets will become ineffectual while remaining locked inside the position contract.
