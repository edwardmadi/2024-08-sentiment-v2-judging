# Transferring the asset tokens out of position won't be possible if isKnown[asset] is set to false

## Summary
Inability to Transfer Tokens from a Position When `isKnownAsset` is Toggled Off for the asset by `owner` of `PositionManager` contract using `toggleKnownAsset` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PositionManager` contract includes a function to toggle the status of an asset as a "known asset" using the `PositionManager.toggleKnownAsset` function. However, the `PositionManager.transfer` function enforces a check that prevents the transfer of tokens if the asset is not recognized as a "known asset." This leads to a situation where users are unable to transfer their tokens out of a position if the `isKnownAsset` status for that asset has been toggled off. This could result in user funds being locked in the position. 

## Impact
User funds will be locked in the `Position`.
