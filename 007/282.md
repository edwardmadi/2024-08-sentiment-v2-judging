# Not removing a token from the position assets upon an owner removing a token from the known assets will cause huge issues

## Summary
Not removing a token from the position assets upon an owner removing a token from the known assets will cause huge issues

## Vulnerability Detail
A user can add a token to his position assets to be used as collateral if that token is marked as known by the owner:
```solidity
    function toggleKnownAsset(address asset) external onlyOwner {
        isKnownAsset[asset] = !isKnownAsset[asset];
        emit ToggleKnownAsset(asset, isKnownAsset[asset]);
    }
```
That token is added to the `positionAssets` set upon calling `Position::addToken()`:
```solidity
positionAssets.insert(asset);
```
An issue arises if the owner decides to later remove a particular asset from the known assets as that asset is not being removed from that set upon that happening. Since it is not being removed from that set, that token will still be used upon calculating the value of the user's collateral. The owner might decide to counteract that by removing the oracle for that asset however that will be even more problematic as liquidations for users using that token will be impossible as they will revert when oracle is equal to address(0).
## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the token from the set upon removing a token from the known assets. However, implementing some kind of a time delay before that finalizes will be important as otherwise, some users might immediately become liquidatable.
