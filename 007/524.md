# Failure to Withdraw a Disabled (previously known) Asset from a Position

## Summary
When an asset is disabled (unknown), neither the position owner nor any authorized party is able to withdraw it from the position. The funds will remain securely locked until the position owner takes steps to re-enable the asset.

## Vulnerability Detail
Initially, we omit any unknown assets that have never been utilized as collateral. We focus on the locking of assets that were `previously known and deposited` by the owner via the `process` function of `PositionManager`.

Imagine the position owner transferred some `known` assets to the position before the `PositionManager` inadvertently or intentionally disabling the asset(being unknown). This situation can arise from two scenarios:
- The asset's value has diminished, rendering it ineligible as collateral. The Position Manager cannot feasibly monitor all open positions and their asset amounts.
- The oracle provider for the asset is unreliable, failing to ensure secure market operations. It might be necessary to block the utilization of the asset to avert unforeseen losses.
Consequently, the position owner is unable to withdraw the asset, as the `transfer` function only permits `known` assets.

```solidity
    function transfer(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address, address, uint256)
        // recipient -> [0:20] address that will receive the transferred tokens
        // asset -> [20:40] address of token to be transferred
        // amt -> [40:72] amount of asset to be transferred
        address recipient = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[20:40]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[40:72]));

>       if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);

        // if the passed amt is type(uint).max assume transfer of the entire balance
        if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);

        Position(payable(position)).transfer(recipient, asset, amt);
        emit Transfer(position, msg.sender, recipient, asset, amt);
    }
```

## Impact
Unless the position manager takes action to re-enable the asset, the funds will remain securely locked and inaccessible indefinitely.

## Recommendation

I suggest 2 possible solutions:

1. Remove the asset verification in the `transfer` function. This should pose no issue, as it is exclusively invoked within the `process` function, followed by a health check of the position. Therefore, as long as the position remains healthy, the ownerâ€™s transfer of assets should proceed without problems.
```diff
    function transfer(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address, address, uint256)
        // recipient -> [0:20] address that will receive the transferred tokens
        // asset -> [20:40] address of token to be transferred
        // amt -> [40:72] amount of asset to be transferred
        address recipient = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[20:40]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[40:72]));

-       if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);

        // if the passed amt is type(uint).max assume transfer of the entire balance
        if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);

        Position(payable(position)).transfer(recipient, asset, amt);
        emit Transfer(position, msg.sender, recipient, asset, amt);
    }
```

2. Keep track of the assets amount deposited/withdrawn by the position owner. As long as this amount remains above zero, it can be withdrawn, irrespective of whether the asset is known.
