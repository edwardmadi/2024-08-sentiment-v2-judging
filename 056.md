# Lack of Feed Address Zero Check at _getPriceWithSanityChecks function for ChainlinkEthOracle contract

### Summary

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/oracle/ChainlinkEthOracle.sol#L99

The contract does not check if the feed address is address(0) before interacting with it. If an invalid address is used, it could lead to unintended behavior or errors.

### Root Cause

Lack of address validation

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If an invalid address is used, it could lead to unintended behavior or errors.

### PoC
