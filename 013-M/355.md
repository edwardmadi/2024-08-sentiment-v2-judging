# Someone can front-run pool initialization and set higher cap

### Summary

In `Pool` anyone can [initialize a pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L562-L567) by setting the following params:
```solidity
        address owner,
        address asset,
        uint128 poolCap,
        bytes32 rateModelKey
```
And here is how we set the pool id:
```solidity
  poolId = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, asset, rateModelKey)));
 ```
 
 This means that same id will be derived for same params, but different `poolCap`s
 Someone can front-run victim's deployment and set larger cap and instantly deposit, before the owner use the setter to make it lower.

### Root Cause

Not using `poolCap` when encoding the pool id.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Someone starts to deploy a base pool with cap X 
- It is important for that user that cap is exactly X

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob calls `initializePool` with WETH, his address as owner, X as interestmodel address and 100e18 as a pool cap
2. Eve front-runs him to deploy the pool and set the cap to 105e18 and deposits all 105e18

### Impact

Bypassing pool owner condition

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use initial pool cap in pool address derivation.
