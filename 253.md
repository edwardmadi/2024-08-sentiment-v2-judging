# Faulty Withdrawal Logic in `Pool` Contract Causes Unnecessary Reverts

## Reference
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L361
## Summary
In the `Pool` contract’s `withdraw` function, incorrect logic limits withdrawals by selecting the minimum of `totalBalance` and `maxWithdrawAssets`. This faulty condition results in reverts even when the overall pool balance can cover the withdrawal request, impacting user experience and contract efficiency.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function’s current logic is designed to check available liquidity before processing a withdrawal. However, it mistakenly returns the smaller value between `totalBalance` and `maxWithdrawAssets`:

```solidity
maxWithdrawAssets = (totalBalance > maxWithdrawAssets) ? maxWithdrawAssets : totalBalance;
```
This logic is incorrect since it limits the maximum available withdrawal to a smaller value unnecessarily. The correct approach should return the larger value to allow maximum liquidity use, preventing unnecessary reverts when the pool holds enough balance.


## Impact
The current logic can lead to unexpected reverts during withdrawal attempts, even when the contract holds sufficient liquidity. This could result in failed transactions, especially in scenarios where available funds should be easily accessible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace the faulty logic with:
```solidity
maxWithdrawAssets = (totalBalance > maxWithdrawAssets) ? totalBalance : maxWithdrawAssets;
```
This adjustment ensures the maximum available liquidity is correctly factored into the withdrawal process, improving contract effeciency.
