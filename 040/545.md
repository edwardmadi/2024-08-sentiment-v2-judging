# Absence of Factory Deployment Verification in SuperPool Constructor Enables Unauthorized Deployments*

## Summary
The current implementation of the `SuperPool` constructor allows for the unrestricted deployment of `SuperPool` contracts outside of the intended `superpoolfactory`. This creates a security risk, as unauthorized entities can deploy `SuperPool` instances that may reference malicious or unintended pool implementations. Since the constructor does not confirm that the deployment originates from the designated factory, it opens the possibility of unauthorized or fraudulent `SuperPool` deployments, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious instances.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the absence of a `superpoolfactory` verification mechanism within the `SuperPool` constructor. Without this check, any actor can deploy a `SuperPool` contract, potentially pointing to a compromised `POOL` or `ASSET` contract. As a result, users could inadvertently interact with a malicious pool contract, particularly in cases where multiple `SuperPool` instances share the same asset but differ in terms of security and legitimacy. The lack of factory verification can also create confusion and increase the likelihood of users engaging with fraudulent contracts.

## Impact
The lack of factory verification in the `SuperPool` constructor allows unauthorized deployments, enabling malicious actors to create counterfeit pools linked to compromised or fraudulent assets. This could lead to significant financial losses and user confusion as multiple `SuperPools` with the same asset may differ in legitimacy. Additionally, without factory-controlled deployment, inflation attacks become possible. The factory includes mechanisms to prevent inflation, but if someone bypasses it, they could manipulate token supply and exploit the protocol. This flaw compromises the security, integrity, and trustworthiness of the `SuperPool` system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, the following improvements are recommended:

- **Add Factory Verification:** Introduce a modifier in the `SuperPool` contract that restricts deployment to the authorized factory contract only, ensuring that new `SuperPool` instances are only deployed by a trusted source.

```solidity
modifier onlyFactory() {
    require(msg.sender == superpoolfactory, "Not authorized factory");
    _;
}
```

- **Enhance Constructor Logic:** Update the constructor to include the factory address as a parameter and set it during deployment. The `onlyFactory` modifier should be applied to enforce that only the factory contract can create new `SuperPool` instances.

```solidity
address public superpoolfactory;

constructor(
    address pool_,
    address asset_,
    address feeRecipient_,
    uint256 fee_,
    uint256 superPoolCap_,
    string memory name_,
    string memory symbol_,
    address factory_
) Ownable() ERC20(name_, symbol_) {
    require(msg.sender == factory_, "Not authorized factory");
    POOL = Pool(pool_);
    ASSET = IERC20(asset_);
    DECIMALS = _tryGetAssetDecimals(ASSET);

    if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
    fee = fee_;
    feeRecipient = feeRecipient_;
    superPoolCap = superPoolCap_;
    superpoolfactory = factory_;
}
```

These changes ensure that `SuperPool` contracts can only be deployed through the authorized factory, improving security and maintaining deployment integrity.
