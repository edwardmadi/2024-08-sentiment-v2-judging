# Delisted assets still stands as a collateral

## Summary
The protocol leaves a chance to list and delist asset types within the protocol. Position manager contract owners have the liberty to call the `toggleKnownAsset` function to add or remove an asset from the list of supported assets. When an asset is delisted, borrowers can still use the asset as a collateral against their positiondebt.
## Vulnerability Detail
If an asset is delisted for any reason, it means such assets are no longer accepted by the protocol , and users can no longer deposit, nor use it as a collateral to back up loans. Although there is a check which succesfully ensures that delisted assets can no longer be deposited but borrowers with such assets can still use the assets as collateral. A similar issue has been reported previously on sentiment protocol, here is a link to the report; https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-11-delisted-assets-can-still-be-deposited-and-borrowed-against-by-accounts-that-already-have-them-sherlock-sentiment-sentiment-git
below is a foundry test to back up my claim 
```solidity
function test_PositionCanStillBorrowWithDelistedAsset() public {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset2.approve(address(positionManager), 10e18);
        asset3.approve(address(positionManager), 10e18);
        asset4.approve(address(positionManager), 10e18);
        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](8);
        (position, actions[0]) = newPosition(
            user,
            bytes32(uint256(0x123456789))
        );
        actions[1] = deposit(address(asset4), 2e18);
        actions[2] = addToken(address(asset4));
        actions[3] = deposit(address(asset2), 2e18);
        actions[4] = addToken(address(asset2));
        actions[5] = deposit(address(asset3), 2e18);
        actions[6] = addToken(address(asset3));
        actions[7] = borrow(fixedRatePool, 2.5e18);
        positionManager.processBatch(position, actions);
        riskModule.isPositionHealthy(position);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // Considering a case where the asset is delisted i.e toggled Unknown!
        vm.startPrank(protocolOwner);
        protocol.positionManager().toggleKnownAsset(address(asset2));
        protocol.positionManager().toggleKnownAsset(address(asset3));
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(user);
        // deposit 1e18 asset2, borrow 1e18 asset1
        Action[] memory action = new Action[](2);
        (position, actions[0]) = newPosition(
            user,
            bytes32(uint256(0x123456789))
        );

        action[0] = borrow(fixedRatePool, 0.25e18);

        action[1] = borrow(fixedRatePool, 0.25e18);
        positionManager.processBatch(position, action);
        // The test passes,which means that an asset that has been delisited
        // can still be borrowed with.
    }
```
## Impact
This questions the integrity of the protocol as it is unfair for a group of users to have access to certain priviledges while others do not.

## Recommendation
If an emergency warrants this scenario, consider a fair closure of all such position and prevent users from borrowing with delisted collateral by including a check against borrowing such asset
```diff
    function borrow(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(uint256, uint256)
        // poolId -> [0:32] pool to borrow from
        // amt -> [32:64] notional amount to be borrowed
        uint256 poolId = uint256(bytes32(data[0:32]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[32:64]));

        // revert if the given pool does not exist
        if (pool.ownerOf(poolId) == address(0)) revert PositionManager_UnknownPool(poolId);
+       if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_DepositUnknownAsset(asset);
        // transfer borrowed assets from given pool to position
        // trigger pool borrow and increase debt owed by the position
        pool.borrow(poolId, position, amt);

        // signals a borrow operation without any actual transfer of borrowed assets
        // any checks needed to validate the borrow must be implemented in the position
        Position(payable(position)).borrow(poolId, amt);
        emit Borrow(position, msg.sender, poolId, amt);
    }
```
