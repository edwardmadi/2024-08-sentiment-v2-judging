# A previously known spender can drain assets due to inability to revoke allowance

## Summary
If a spender is removed from the `isKnownSpender` mapping, users cannot decrease their allowance, potentially allowing a malicious spender to continue transferring assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner or authorized operator of a position [can approve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L341-L358) an amount of assets to a spender using `approve` function. For this to occur, the spender must be listed in the `isKnownSpender` mapping:
```solidity
        if (!isKnownSpender[spender]) revert PositionManager_UnknownSpender(spender);
```

If the protocol removes a spender from the `isKnownSpender` mapping due to reasons such as malicious actions or getting compromised, the owner of a position will be unable to decrease the allowance of the malicious spender because the transaction will revert [at this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L351):
```solidity
        if (!isKnownSpender[spender]) revert PositionManager_UnknownSpender(spender);
```
As a result, the malicious spender can still transfer the assets to themselves.

## Impact
Users may lose funds because they are unable to clear the allowance of a previously known spender.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow users to decrease the allowance to zero even if the spender is no longer known:

```diff
    /// @dev Approve a spender to use assets from a position
    function approve(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        // data -> abi.encodePacked(address, address, uint256)
        // spender -> [0:20] address to be approved
        // asset -> [20:40] address of token to be approves
        // amt -> [40:72] amount of asset to be approved
        address spender = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[20:40]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[40:72]));

        if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_ApproveUnknownAsset(asset);
-       if (!isKnownSpender[spender]) revert PositionManager_UnknownSpender(spender);
+       if (amt > 0 && !isKnownSpender[spender]) {
+            revert PositionManager_UnknownSpender(spender);
+       }

        // if the passed amt is type(uint).max assume approval of the entire balance
        if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);

        Position(payable(position)).approve(asset, spender, amt);
        emit Approve(position, msg.sender, spender, asset, amt);
    }
```
