# Same Heartbeat Assumed For All Price Feeds

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract currently assumes a uniform heartbeat (e.g., one hour) for all Chainlink price feeds. However, different assets may have different heartbeats; for instance, some assets might have a 24-hour heartbeat (e.g. Arbitrum). By enforcing a single, fixed heartbeat across all feeds, the contract inadvertently causes issues for assets with longer heartbeats.

## Impact
This vulnerability can severely disrupt the functionality of the contract when dealing with assets that have longer heartbeats.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, the contract should allow the heartbeat to be configured individually for each price feed. This would ensure that the contract accurately respects the intended validity period of each assetâ€™s price data, thereby preventing unnecessary downtime and maintaining consistent operation across all supported assets.
