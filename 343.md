# There is no validation for data input in the `process()` and `processBatch()` functions in the `positionManager.sol` contract, this has the potential to cause a slippage issue, especially for the `exec()` function

### Summary

<body>
<!--StartFragment--><p>There is no validation for data input in the <code>process()</code> and <code>processBatch()</code> functions in the <code>positionManager.sol</code> contract, this has the potential to cause a vulnerability, especially for the <code>exec()</code> function. The <code>exec()</code> function performs arbitrary calls based on data (<code>bytes calldata data</code>) from user input. The result of decoding the data is the target contract, value, function selected in the target contract, and data to fill in the parameters required by the function. Sentiment has several contracts and functions as its whitelist :</p>

<p>For example, the <code>exec()</code> function is called and the function called is <code>Pendle::swapExactTokenForPt()</code>. In this function there is an important variable, namely <code>minPtOut</code> which functions as slippage protection. This feature aims to check whether the number of PT tokens received is as it should be. But because there is no checking of the data inputted by the user, the value of the variable can be <code>minPtOut = 0</code>. This has the potential to cause a slippage issue (users can receive less PT tokens than they should due to certain circumstances) and users can become targets of sandwich attacks (attacker monitors the Pendle market and manipulates it so that users get less PT tokens than they should).</p>
<p>Although the health of the position is checked, this is not enough if the position is a new position that has been created and there is no debt in it and no assets in it, then the check result is healthy even though the PT token received is less than should be.</p>
<p>Note :</p>
<ol>
<li>This slippage issue can occur for <code>Pendle::swapExactPtForToken()</code> due to <code>exactPtIn = 0</code>.</li>
<li>This slippage issue can occur for <code>GMX::mintAndStakeGlp()</code> and <code>GMX::unstakeAndReedeemGlp()</code> due to the <code>_minGlp</code> and <code>_minOut</code> variables being set to 0.</li>

### Root Cause

In [positionManager::exec()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L289-L304) there is no checking for input data from user

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User call `process()` / `processBatch()` function with operation `data = exec()` and no input value for `minPtOut`
2. `exec()` function make arbitrary call to the whitelist function (i.e`Pendle::swapExactTokenForPt()`)
3. Due to certain circumstances or attacker make a sandwich attack targeting user, the number of PT tokens received by the user at this position is less than it should be but the function not revert because lack of slippage protection

### Impact

User received less tokens than expected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider decode the input data and validate 

```solidity
function _checkInputData(bytes calldata data) internal returns (uint256 minPtOut) {
        // Decode the target address and value first
        address target = address(bytes20(data[:20]));
        uint256 value = uint256(bytes32(data[20:52]));

        bytes4 funcSelector = bytes4(data[52:56]);

        // Decode the rest of the calldata starting from the 56th byte
        // Assume the layout is: receiver, market, minPtOut, guessPtOut, input, limit
        // skip to where minPtOut should be, which is after receiver and market
        
        // Receiver address (20 bytes) + market address (20 bytes) = 40 bytes to skip
        uint256 offset = 56 + 20 + 20;

        // Extract minPtOut (32 bytes)
        minPtOut = abi.decode(data[offset:offset + 32], (uint256));

        // Ensure minPtOut is not zero
        require(minPtOut > 0, "minPtOut cannot be zero");
    }
```
