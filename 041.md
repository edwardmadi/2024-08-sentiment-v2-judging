# Unverified External Calls in exec Function for PositionManager contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L289

The exec function allows arbitrary external calls, provided the target-function pair is recognized by the protocol. However, there is no verification of the target contractâ€™s behavior, which could allow calls to malicious or faulty contracts.


### Root Cause

The exec function allows arbitrary external calls.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Malicious contracts could exploit this to drain funds, lock assets, or cause the position to behave unexpectedly.

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableProtocol {
    // Mapping of allowed target-function pairs (intended to restrict calls)
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes4 => bool)) public allowedCalls;

    constructor() {
        // Suppose only this target-function pair is allowed initially
        allowedCalls[address(0x123456789abcdef)]["transfer(address,uint256)"] = true;
    }

    function exec(address target, bytes memory data) public {
        bytes4 functionSelector;
        assembly {
            functionSelector := mload(add(data, 32))
        }

        // Check if the call is allowed (insufficient validation)
        require(allowedCalls[target][functionSelector], "Call not allowed");

        (bool success, ) = target.call(data);
        require(success, "External call failed");
    }

    // Function to authorize a new target-function pair (assumed only accessible to admins)
    function authorizeCall(address target, bytes4 functionSelector) public {
        allowedCalls[target][functionSelector] = true;
    }
}

// Example of an attacker-controlled contract
contract Attacker {
    VulnerableProtocol public vulnerableProtocol;

    constructor(VulnerableProtocol _vulnerableProtocol) {
        vulnerableProtocol = _vulnerableProtocol;
    }

    function exploit() public {
        // Attacker crafts a malicious payload to call an arbitrary function
        address target = 0x123456789abcdef;  // Assuming this is a valid target
        bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSignature("withdraw(uint256)", 1000);

        // Execute the payload using the vulnerable exec function
        vulnerableProtocol.exec(target, data);
    }
}
```
**Exploit Explanation**
Vulnerable exec Function:

The exec function is intended to allow only certain target-function pairs to be executed.
It checks if the call is allowed by verifying if the target and functionSelector are in the allowedCalls mapping.
However, the allowedCalls check might be overly simplistic, potentially allowing attackers to execute unintended calls if the mapping is poorly managed.
**Attacker's Strategy:**

The attacker deploys their own contract (Attacker) and initializes it with the VulnerableProtocol contract's address.
The attacker then crafts a malicious payload using abi.encodeWithSignature("withdraw(uint256)", 1000), intending to call a withdraw function on a target contract.
The attacker calls the exploit function in their contract, which invokes the exec function of the vulnerable protocol with the malicious payload.
If the protocol's allowedCalls mapping is not properly restrictive, this call may succeed, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary functions on the target contract.

### Mitigation

To prevent such vulnerabilities, the exec function should:

Implement strict validation logic to ensure only explicitly authorized target-function pairs can be executed.
Consider implementing role-based access control to limit who can authorize new calls.
Implement additional security checks, such as requiring multi-sig approval for sensitive functions or using time delays for high-risk operations.
