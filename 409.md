# Address collision with a position can lead to draining the whole protocol


## Summary
An attacker can try to find an address collision between a position and an EOA that she controls, which can then be used to borrow as much as possible and empty the collateral. This way an attacker can drain all of the available liquidity throughout all markets.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is currently being discussed in [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-makerdao-endgame-judging/issues/64). Personally I believe that this should not be a medium and with the current price for the attacker is a low, however, submitting this in case this is an accepted medium severity issue in sherlock:

1- Attacker finds a position and an EOA with the same address [`PositionManager.sol:278`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L278)
2- Attacker initiates the position
Sends transactions from EOA and adds EOA to the isAuth:
 -> 3- Attacker takes a flashloan and use as collateral in the position
 -> 4- Borrows as much as possible against the flashloan and drains all of the pools
 -> 5- Transfers out the collateral with the EOA
 -> 6- pay back the flashloan

## Impact
An attacker can drain all of the liquidity in the pools.
