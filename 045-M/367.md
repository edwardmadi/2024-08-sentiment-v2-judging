# Incomplete pool isolation when a position encounters bad debt

### Summary

The isolation between pools is incomplete when a position goes into bad debt and when the protocol decides to socialize the loss.

### Root Cause

The `Position` contract allows to borrow from up to 5 different pools that can all have a different asset and different LTVs for the same collaterals (up to 5 collaterals). This means a user can borrow ETH and USDC at the same time using WBTC if both pools allow it. One may have 80% LTV while the other have 50% LTV.

The problem is that the [`liquidate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/src/PositionManager.sol#L430-L430) function can only liquidate if the healthfactor is positive after the liquidation, that means that as soon as the position is slightly into bad debt it is not possible to liquidate with profit for liquidation bots.

So if a user borrows from pools with unsafe parameters and pools with safe parameters at the same time, the unsafe pool could lead the user into bad debt and affect the reimbursement of the safe pools which breaks the supposed isolation of pools.

Additionally the function [`liquidateBadDebt()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/src/PositionManager.sol#L446-L446) liquidates the full position no matter what pool is responsible of the bad debt. This means if a user used 2 pools, one with safe parameters and one with unsafe and ended up in bad debt then both pools get affected by the bad debt.

The collateral is then sent to the protocol address and pools cannot be donated to, so the pool depositors loss is immediate.

The protocol owner could decide to liquidate the position at its loss (reimbursing more than the collateral it receives) to make sure legit pools don't suffer from the unfair socialization. But it seems unlikely and will result in a loss for the Sentiment treasury because of unsafe parameters from pool owners and users which could happen often.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. 2 pools accepting the same collateral, one with safe parameters and one with unsafe (very high LTV and or borrowing asset that can go up in price quickly)

### External pre-conditions

1. high market volatility, common in crypto especially for small assets

### Attack Path

1. POOL A accepts asset A as collateral with 75% LTV and POOL B with 95% LTV, they both lend the same token.
2. User borrows mostly from POOL B and a little from POOL A and maxes out his LTV.
3. Price goes down because of volatility by 10% in very little time (and/or borrowed asset price goes up).
4. Position cannot be liquidated at profit anymore, Protocol decides to socialize the bad debt.
5. Depositors of POOL A get their share value reduced even though their pool is theoretically not in bad debt and could have sustained the 10% crash on its own.

This can be made even more likely and unfair if POOL B lended a different token and it went up during the collateral price dump, increasing the debt to be repaid and leading to bad debt faster.

### Impact

- Incomplete isolation. Pool depositors can loose part of their deposit even when using a pool with safe parameters

### PoC

Add in `PositionManager.t.sol`:
```solidity
function testLiquidateBadDebt() public {
        testSimpleDepositCollateral(100 ether); //100 asset2 as collateral -> 100 * 0.5 = 50e

        //setup another pool similar to the other one but high ltv of 95%
        asset1.mint(address(this), 10_000 ether);
        asset1.approve(address(pool), 10_000 ether);
        pool.deposit(linearRatePool2, 10_000 ether, address(0x9));
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        riskEngine.setLtvBounds(0.1e18, 0.98e18); //prod values according to Sherlock contest doc
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        riskEngine.requestLtvUpdate(linearRatePool2, address(asset2), 0.95e18);
        riskEngine.acceptLtvUpdate(linearRatePool2, address(asset2));
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(positionOwner);
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(linearRatePool, 0.5 ether); //borrow 0.5 asset1 minus fee to position -> 0.5 * 10 -> 5e (75% LTV)
        bytes memory data2 = abi.encode(linearRatePool2, 4.1 ether); //borrow 4.1 asset1 minus fee to position -> 4.1 * 10 -> 41e (95% LTV)

        Action memory action = Action({ op: Operation.Borrow, data: data });
        Action memory action2 = Action({ op: Operation.Borrow, data: data2 });
        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](2);
        actions[0] = action;
        actions[1] = action2;

        //Min1: 5e * 1e18 / 0.75e18 -> 6.66e
        //Min2: 41e * 1e18 / 0.95e18 -> 43.15e
        //Total min: ~49.81 < 50e collateral so should work
        PositionManager(positionManager).processBatch(position, actions);

        //46e of debt for 50e of collateral
        //collateral price goes down by 10%
        FixedPriceOracle testOracle2 = new FixedPriceOracle(0.45e18);
        vm.startPrank(protocolOwner);
        protocol.riskEngine().setOracle(address(asset2), address(testOracle2));
        vm.stopPrank();

        //46e of debt for 45e of collateral, cannot be liquidated at profit anymore
        uint256 prevTotalAsset1 = pool.getTotalAssets(linearRatePool);
        uint256 prevTotalAsset2 = pool.getTotalAssets(linearRatePool2);

        //liquidate bad debt
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        PositionManager(positionManager).liquidateBadDebt(position);

        //both pool get their total assets reduced
        assertEq(prevTotalAsset1 - 0.5 ether, pool.getTotalAssets(linearRatePool));
        assertEq(prevTotalAsset2 - 4.1 ether, pool.getTotalAssets(linearRatePool2));
    }
```

### Mitigation

Pools should be better isolated.

The function [`liquidate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/src/PositionManager.sol#L430-L430) could allow to liquidate per pool instead of per position. Allowing to liquidate the pool with safe parameter that shouldn't be affected by the bad debt.
This might also require a rework of the health factor calculation as the position will still be in bad debt.

The function [`liquidateBadDebt()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/src/PositionManager.sol#L446-L446) could allow the protocol owner to select the `poolId` to socialize the debt on.
