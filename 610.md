# ERC6909.sol Does Not Follow EIP-6909 Implementation

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ERC6909` contract does not fully comply with the `EIP-6909` standard as specified in [EIP-6909](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909). Below are the specific deviations and areas that need to be addressed to ensure compliance:

1. Transfer Function:
* The transfer function in the contract does not follow the EIP-6909 standard. According to the standard, the function signature should be:
```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);

```
However, the current implementation is:
```solidity
function transfer(address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool);

```

2. supportsInterface Function:
* The supportsInterface function should be marked as public pure according to the EIP-6909 standard:
```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public pure virtual returns (bool);

```
current Implementation
```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool);

```

## Recommendation
Update the ERC6909.sol contract to align with the EIP-6909 standard. Ensure that all function signatures, visibility, and behaviors match the specifications outlined in the standard.
