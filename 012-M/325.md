# `SuperPool#convertToShares` violates ERC4626

### Summary

In contrest [README](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/349) it is written that `SuperPool.sol is strictly ERC4626 compliant`, which means that it must comply all EIP4626 `MUST` statements.
In the spec it is written that `convertToShares` `MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault.`, but [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L191-L197) we increase `totalSupply` by the `feeShares` accured for `feeRecipient`, which imitates `previewDeposit` behaviour, but violates `ERC4626convertToShares`

### Root Cause

- Increasing `totalSupply` by the `feeShares` accrued for `feeRecipient` inside `convertToShares`
- EIP contradiction

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Violating a behavior of an EIP function specification.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement function to rawly calculate shares based on last contract state update:
```solidity
    function convertToShares(
        uint256 assets,
        uint256 totalAssets,
        uint256 totalShares
    ) external pure returns (uint256 shares) {
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, totalAssets, totalShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```
