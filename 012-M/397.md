# SuperPool is not ERC 4626 compliant

## Summary

According to the README, the `SuperPool` contract must strictly comply with `ERC4626`, but there are some irregularities.

## Vulnerability Detail

* convertToAssets and convertToShares:

> Both convertToAssets and convertToShares should return ideal results (no slippage or fees) so that other smart contracts can accurately calculate the optimal trade size.

* maxDeposit, maxMint, maxWithdraw, maxRedeem:

> These functions should return 0 when the contract is paused.

## Impact

These errors may cause unexpected behavior and issues in future tools or smart contracts that rely on ERC4626 compliance.
