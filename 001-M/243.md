# Missing whenNotPaused() modifier in Critical Functions of SuperPool.sol

## Summary
The `SuperPool.sol` contract inherits from `Pausable.sol`, allowing the contract owner to pause and unpause contract functions in case of an emergency. However, certain critical functions `deposit()`, ` mint()`, and `addPool()` do not check if the contract is paused before executing. This oversight could allow users to deposit funds, mint shares, and add pools even when the contract is in a paused state, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors and security risks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following functions lack the necessary checks to determine whether the contract is paused:
1. **deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver):**
    This function allows users to deposit assets and receive corresponding shares in return. However, it does not check if the contract is 
    paused, potentially allowing deposits during the paused state.
2. **mint(uint256 shares, address receiver):**
    This function allows users to mint new shares by specifying the number of shares they wish to receive. Like the deposit function, it 
    also lacks a check to ensure that the contract is not paused.
3. **addPool(uint256 poolId, uint256 assetCap):**
    This function allows the contract owner to add a new pool to the SuperPool. Since there is no pausable check, pools can be added 
    even when the contract is paused, which could be against the intended functionality.

## Impact
   If these functions are allowed to execute while the contract is paused, it could lead to several potential issues:

**Security Risks:** Allowing deposits and minting during a paused state may expose the contract to exploits or malicious actions, 
   particularly if the pause function was activated in response to a detected vulnerability.
**Operational Risks:** Adding pools while the contract is paused could lead to inconsistencies in the contractâ€™s state and operational 
  disruptions.
**Violation of Contract Logic:** Pausing a contract is typically done to prevent all state-changing operations. Bypassing this could 
   violate the intended safety mechanisms.

## POC
Add these test cases in SuperPool.t.sol .
``` javascript
function testDepositWhenSuperpoolIsPaused() public {
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        superPool.addPool(linearRatePool, 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // @audit : SuperPool is paused now
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        superPool.togglePause();
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset1.mint(user, 100 ether);
        asset1.approve(address(superPool), 100 ether);

        uint256 expectedShares = superPool.previewDeposit(100 ether);
        uint256 shares = superPool.deposit(100 ether, user);
        assertEq(shares, expectedShares);

        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(pool)), 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
``` javascript
function testMintWhenSuperpoolIsPaused() public {
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        superPool.addPool(linearRatePool, 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // @audit : SuperPool is paused now
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        superPool.togglePause();
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset1.mint(user, 100 ether);
        asset1.approve(address(superPool), 100 ether);
        superPool.mint( user , 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

```
```javascript
function testAddPoolWhenSuperpoolIsPaused() public {
        // @audit : SuperPool is paused now
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        superPool.togglePause();
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        vm.startPrank(poolOwner);
        superPool.addPool(linearRatePool, 100 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the identified risks, it is recommended to implement the whenNotPaused modifier from the Pausable contract in the relevant functions. This will ensure that these functions cannot be executed while the contract is paused.
