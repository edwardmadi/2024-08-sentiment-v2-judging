# User can withdraw from the Paused Superpool

## Summary
The `superpool` contract allows users to withdraw funds even when the pool is paused, which contradicts the intended purpose of the `togglePause()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `togglePause()` function, controlled by the contract owner, is intended to pause pool activities like withdrawals. However, `withdraw()` function and `redeem()` function lacks a check for the pool's paused status, allowing users to withdraw funds even when the pool is supposed to be paused.

## Impact
The ability to withdraw from a paused pool undermines the control mechanisms intended by the owner, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a modifier to the withdraw() function and redeem() function to check the paused status of the pool, preventing withdraws when the pool is paused.

```solidity
modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Pool is paused");
    _;
}

 function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Withdraw logic
}

function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 assets)  {
   // Redeem logic
}   
```
