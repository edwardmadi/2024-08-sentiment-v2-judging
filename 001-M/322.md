# `SuperPool` has a `togglePause` function, but lack `whenNotPaused` modifier

### Summary

`SuperPool` inherits from `Pausable`, which provides a pausability. The problem is that protocol has not used `whenNotPaused` modifier to any of the function, which makes the whole `Pausable` functionality useless. Contract also have [togglePaused](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L164-L167) function, which would be useless. The issue impact is that contract does not work as expected. Issue is confirmed by the sponsor:
