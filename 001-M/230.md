# Superpool has a Pause Function But can never be paused.

## Summary

In the SuperPool contract, like the Pool contract, the owner should be able to pause the pool in case of emergencies or other situations where it is necessary to temporarily stop certain operations (DEPOSIT). However, the current implementation of the SuperPool contract does not properly enforce this pausing mechanism on the deposit function. As a result, even if the owner pauses the contract, the deposit function can still be called, effectively rendering the pause function ineffective.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `togglePause` function is designed to allow the owner of the SuperPool to pause and unpause the contract as needed. Pausing the contract is a common practice to protect against unforeseen issues, such as security vulnerabilities . However, in the current implementation, there is no modifier like `whenNotPaused` applied to the deposit function. This omission means that even when the contract is paused, users can still make deposits, which could lead to unintended consequences or exacerbate issues the pause was intended to mitigate.


Based on the POOL contract implementation.

```solidity
@audit>>>     /// @notice Toggle paused state for a pool to restrict deposit and borrows
                          function togglePause(uint256 poolId) external {
                        if (msg.sender != ownerOf[poolId]) revert Pool_OnlyPoolOwner(poolId, msg.sender);
                         PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];
                        pool.isPaused = !pool.isPaused;
                      emit PoolPauseToggled(poolId, pool.isPaused);
    }

```

```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 poolId, uint256 assets, address receiver) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];

@audit>>>         if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);
```


**SuperPool Implementation**
The issue can be illustrated as follows:

```solidity
@audit>>>   /// @notice Toggle pause state of the SuperPool
                      function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
                            if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
                                    else Pausable._pause();
                                       }   

// Deposit function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier


@audit>>>      function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

 
@audit>>>         function _deposit(address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal {
     
       // assume that lastTotalAssets are up to date
        if (lastTotalAssets + assets > superPoolCap) revert SuperPool_SuperPoolCapReached();
        // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
        ASSET.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
        ERC20._mint(receiver, shares);
        _supplyToPools(assets);
        lastTotalAssets += assets;
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    }

@audit>>>    shows that contract should be pausable   >>   contract SuperPool is Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, ERC20 {

}
```

Without the `whenNotPaused` modifier on the `deposit` function, the pausing mechanism does not fully take effect, allowing the function to be executed even when the contract is paused.


## Impact

The lack of proper enforcement of the pausing mechanism in the SuperPool contract can lead to significant risks. For example, during a security incident or when the protocol is under attack, the inability to properly pause all critical functions could allow the attack to continue or cause further damage. Additionally, it undermines the control and security measures that the owner should have over the contract's operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To ensure that the pausing mechanism in the SuperPool contract functions as intended, it is recommended to apply the `whenNotPaused` modifier to all functions that should be restricted when the contract is paused. Specifically, the `deposit` function should be updated as follows:

### Suggested Implementation:

```solidity
// Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the deposit function

    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public  nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

```

By adding this modifier, the deposit function will be properly restricted when the contract is paused, ensuring that the pausing mechanism works as intended and that the contract is protected during critical situations.


The ERC4626 is deposit and maxdeposit also should also reflect this.
