# User can deposit into the `superpool` even when the pool is paused.

## Summary
The `superpool` contract allows users to deposit funds even when the pool is paused, which contradicts the intended purpose of the `togglePause()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `togglePause()` function, controlled by the contract owner, is intended to pause all pool activities like deposits and withdrawals. However, `deposit()` function and `mint()` function lacks a check for the pool's paused status, allowing users to deposit funds even when the pool is supposed to be paused.

## Impact
The ability to deposit into a paused pool undermines the control mechanisms intended by the owner, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a modifier to the `deposit()` and `mint()` function to check the paused status of the pool, preventing deposits when the pool is paused.

```solidity
modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Pool is paused");
    _;
}

function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 shares)  {
    // Deposit logic
}

function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public nonReentrant whenNotPaused  returns (uint256 assets) {
   // Mint logic
}   
```
