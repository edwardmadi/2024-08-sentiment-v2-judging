# Superpool can not be paused despite the implemented functionality

## Summary
`Superpool` can not be paused despite the implemented functionality
## Vulnerability Detail
The `Superpool` contract is supposed to be pausable as first of all, it inherits the `Pausable` contract and it also has the following function:
```solidity
function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```
However, in order for any of the functions to not work whenever the contract is paused/not paused, they have to implement the `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused` modifiers. None of the functions do that, thus the contract can not actually be paused despite the implemented functionality.
## Impact
`Superpool` can not be paused despite the implemented functionality
