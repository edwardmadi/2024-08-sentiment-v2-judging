# The Pausable functionalit of `SuperPool.sol` contract is useless as its not used on contracts functions

## Summary
The Pausable functionalit of `SuperPool.sol` contract is useless as its not used on contracts functions

## Vulnerability Detail
`SuperPool.sol` has inherited openzeppelin's `Pausable.sol` so that pausable state of contracts can be managed. 

```solidity
contract SuperPool is Ownable, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, ERC20 {
```

The contracts has provided `togglePause()` function to toggle the pause state of SuperPool contract which can only be accessed by contract owner.

```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle pause state of the SuperPool
    function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```

As per the discussions with Protocol team, they have missed marking few functions pausable so its in issue and deviating from intended design.

As per contest readme, `The SuperPool is heavily inspired from and modified from Yearn v3 and Metamorpho vault designs` so Yearn V3 has used pausable functionality on functions like deposit and mint functions, etc.

## Impact
The inherited `Pausable` functionality would be useless as `togglePause()` function wont make any difference on contracts functions access even when the contract is paused as Pausable.sol's `whenNotPaused` or `whenPaused` modifiers have not been used on any of the `SuperPool` contracts functions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the inherited openzeppelin's Pausable.sol functions having whenNotPaused or whenPaused modifiers on SuperPool.sol functions as intended by protocol design as these are missed as per Protocol team.
