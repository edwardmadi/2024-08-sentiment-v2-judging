# The `SuperPool.sol` contract is supposed to have `Pausable` functions, but none have the modifier

### Summary

The `SuperPool.sol` contract inherits the `Pausable` library and even implements a [`togglePause`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L164) function for the owner to use:

```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle pause state of the SuperPool
    function togglePause() external onlyOwner {
        if (Pausable.paused()) Pausable._unpause();
        else Pausable._pause();
    }
```

However, none of the functions in the contract use the `whenPaused` or the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the `Pausable` library. It is confirmed that the devs forgot to designate the `Pausable` functions.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The contract has multiple functions that are supposed to be `Pausable`. Due to a mistake, the `whenNotPaused` and `whenPaused` modifiers were not added to the functions that should have been. The contract now is not `Pausable` and users can use it even in times when they shouldn't be.

### PoC

1. Some functions that handle funds are supposed to be `paused` when owner decided to.
2. Owner calls the `togglePause` function.
3. All of the functions are still usable by the users

### Mitigation

Add the desired `whenPaused` and `whenNotPaused` modifiers to the desired functions.
