# Planned large liquidation fees will make liquidation not profitable causing bad debt

## Summary
Planned large liquidation fees will make liquidation not profitable causing bad debt

## Vulnerability Detail
The planned values for the liquidation fee and liquidation discount are (0-30%,10%) 
```solidity
Liquidation Fee = 0 (Might be increased to 20-30% in the future)
Liquidation Discount = 10% = 100000000000000000
```

The liqudation fee is taken directly from the captured assets and not the profits of the liquidator.

```solidity
    function _transferAssetsToLiquidator(address position, AssetData[] calldata assetData) internal {
       
            uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
            // transfer fee amt to protocol
            Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
            // transfer difference to the liquidator
            Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
```
Since the liquidation discount is capped to 10%, maxCapturableAmount will be:

maxCapturableAmount = liquidatingAmount * 100/(100-10) == 1.111 * liquidationAmount

setting liquidation fee to anything greater than ((1.111 - 1)/1.111) * 100% == 9.99% will result in the liquidation being a loss for the liquidator

## Impact
Liquidations won't happen causing bad debt and loss for the depositors
