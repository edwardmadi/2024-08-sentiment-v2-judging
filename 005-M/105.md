# Portocol fee on liquidations is calculated wrongly

## Summary
Protocol fees on liquidations are calculated incorrectly, which could lead to bad debt if enabled.

## Vulnerability Detail
The README indicates that the current liquidation fee is 0% but is expected to increase to 20%-30% in the near future.

> Liquidation Fee = 0 (Might be increased to 20-30% in the future)

However, the fee is taken from the entire asset amount rather than the liquidator's profit. For example, if a liquidator repays $90 for a position and receives $100, a 20% fee would leave them with only $80 in value, causing him to occur a loss.

```solidity
    //@audit fee is taken from asset amount, not profit
    uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
    Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
    Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
```
This approach means that a liquidation fee above `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` (10%) could discourage liquidations, leading to bad debt. Even a fee below 10% could reduce liquidators' profits, making them less likely to liquidate if the price moves significantly.

## Impact
Liquidators may not be incentivized to liquidate, leading to the system accruing bad debt.

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the formula to calculate the fee based on the liquidator's profit rather than the total asset value.
