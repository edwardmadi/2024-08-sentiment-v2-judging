# Liquidator will lose it's funds while liquidation.

## Summary
According to contest readme liquidation fee can be set to 20%-30% in future "Liquidation Fee = 0 (Might be increased to 20-30% in the future)". But the discount to liquidator is 10% "Liquidation Discount = 10% = 100000000000000000".

Which means the fee on liquidation taken by the protocol is higher than the percentage(Incentive) given to the liquidator. That means if user is liquidating the position which have bad debt of 10 ETH. And the liquidator paying the position whole loan than debtRepaidValue paid by liquidator is 10 ETH `debtRepaidValue += oracle.getValueInEth(poolAsset, amt);`. And the maximum fund he can get in return is ` uint256 maxSeizedAssetValue = debtRepaidValue.mulDiv(1e18, (1e18 - discount));` which rounds to 11 ETH.

But the liquidation fee can be set to 20%-30% in future. If fee is set to 20% than liquidator will get maxSeizedAssetValue - liquidation fee which will be around 8.8 ETH.
`
uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
// transfer fee amt to protocol
Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
// transfer difference to the liquidator
Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
` 
Let's understand it step by step.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. liquidate() function:
```solidity
    struct DebtData {
      uint256 poolId;
      uint256 amt;
    }

    struct AssetData {
      // token address
      address asset;
      // amount of collateral to be received by liquidator
      uint256 amt;
    }

    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData, //array of DebtData struct
        AssetData[] calldata assetData  //array of AssetData struct
    ) external nonReentrant {
        riskEngine.validateLiquidation(position, debtData, assetData);

        // liquidate
        _transferAssetsToLiquidator(position, assetData);
        _repayPositionDebt(position, debtData);

        // position should be within risk thresholds after liquidation
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
        emit Liquidation(position, msg.sender, ownerOf[position]);
    }
```
2. Let's say liquidator tries to liquidate the valid position for liquidation. And decides to pay whole loan of the position.
3.  _validateSeizedAssetValue() function:
```solidity
  function _validateSeizedAssetValue(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,//debtData[] struct contains poolId and amount to be paid by liquidator
        AssetData[] calldata assetData, // assetData struct for collateral assets to be received by the liquidator 
        uint256 discount //Liquidation Discount = 10%
    ) internal view {
        // compute value of debt repaid by the liquidator
        uint256 debtRepaidValue;
        uint256 debtLength = debtData.length;//length of array for struct debtData[] struct contains poolId and amount to be paid by liquidator
        for (uint256 i; i < debtLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = debtData[i].poolId; //getting pool ID
            uint256 amt = debtData[i].amt; //getting debt amount which will be paid by liwuidator
            if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position);//getting total position debt amount
            address poolAsset = pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId);//getting pool ID asset
            IOracle oracle = IOracle(riskEngine.getOracleFor(poolAsset));
            debtRepaidValue += oracle.getValueInEth(poolAsset, amt);//getting repaid value/debt amount in ETH
        }

        // compute value of assets seized by the liquidator
        uint256 assetSeizedValue;
        uint256 assetDataLength = assetData.length;//lenght of array for assetData struct for collateral assets to be received by the liquidator 
        for (uint256 i; i < assetDataLength; ++i) {
            IOracle oracle = IOracle(riskEngine.getOracleFor(assetData[i].asset));
            //Getting the collateral amount of position whihc liquidator should get.
            assetSeizedValue += oracle.getValueInEth(assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt);//value in ETH the assset amount whihc lquidator will get.
        }

        // max asset value that can be seized by the liquidator
        //We are getting the maximum value which liquidator can get back if he repay this much amount like more 10% of what is repaying.
        uint256 maxSeizedAssetValue = debtRepaidValue.mulDiv(1e18, (1e18 - discount));
        if (assetSeizedValue > maxSeizedAssetValue) {
            revert RiskModule_SeizedTooMuch(assetSeizedValue, maxSeizedAssetValue);
        }
    }
```
4. This function is calculating the  debtRepaidValue paid by liquidator in ETH and the value which liquidator is asking in return. But  assetSeizedValue which liquidator is asking in return should be lesser or equal to the maxSeizedAssetValue. Means if liquidator is paying debtRepaidValue = 10ETH than maxSeizedAssetValue will be around 11 ETH at thediscount rate of 10%.
5. _transferAssetsToLiquidator function:
```solidity
    function _transferAssetsToLiquidator(address position, AssetData[] calldata assetData) internal {
        // transfer position assets to the liquidator and accrue protocol liquidation fees
        uint256 assetDataLength = assetData.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < assetDataLength; ++i) {
            // ensure assetData[i] is in the position asset list
            if (Position(payable(position)).hasAsset(assetData[i].asset) == false) {
                revert PositionManager_SeizeInvalidAsset(position, assetData[i].asset);
            }
            // compute fee amt
            // [ROUND] liquidation fee is rounded down, in favor of the liquidator
            uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
            // transfer fee amt to protocol
            Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
            // transfer difference to the liquidator
            Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
        }
    }
```
6. As per contest readme Liquidation Fee can be set to 20%-30%. If liquidationFee is 20% percent than funds liquidator will get in return will be -20%.
7. For example liquidator is paying 10ETH worth of `debtData` and asking 11ETH worth of `assetData`in return because of Liquidation Discount set to 10% as per contest readme but liquidator will get 8.8ETH worth of asset back because of liquidationFee deduction.
8. So this is how liquidator will lose it's funds while liquidating the position.
 
## Impact
User can lose funds while liquidating the position which will leads to no one will wants to liquidate the bad debt positions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The mitigation is to limit `Liquidation Fee` to lower than `Liquidation Discount` which is 10%.
