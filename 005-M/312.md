# The liquidationFee should be applied to the profit from the liquidation, rather than to all the assets obtained by the liquidator.


## Summary
The liquidationFee is applied to the entire amount of the liquidated collateral, rather than just the profit from the liquidation. This could lead to losses for the liquidator, removing their incentive to perform the liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
@>>        riskEngine.validateLiquidation(position, debtData, assetData);

        // liquidate
@>>        _transferAssetsToLiquidator(position, assetData);
        _repayPositionDebt(position, debtData);

        // position should be within risk thresholds after liquidation
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
        emit Liquidation(position, msg.sender, ownerOf[position]);
    }
```
In the liquidation function, riskEngine.validateLiquidation checks the liquidator’s assetData, where their maximum profit is limited to the discount price (10%).

```javascript
    function _transferAssetsToLiquidator(address position, AssetData[] calldata assetData) internal {
        // transfer position assets to the liquidator and accrue protocol liquidation fees
        uint256 assetDataLength = assetData.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < assetDataLength; ++i) {
            // ensure assetData[i] is in the position asset list
            if (Position(payable(position)).hasAsset(assetData[i].asset) == false) {
                revert PositionManager_SeizeInvalidAsset(position, assetData[i].asset);
            }
            // compute fee amt
            // [ROUND] liquidation fee is rounded down, in favor of the liquidator
@>>            uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
            // transfer fee amt to protocol
            Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
            // transfer difference to the liquidator
            Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
        }
    }
```

However, in the _transferAssetsToLiquidator function, we can see that the fee is being charged on the amount of collateral the liquidator receives, which is clearly incorrect.


Example Scenario:

	•	The liquidator spends borrow tokens worth 90 and receives collateral worth 100.
	•	If we apply a liquidation fee of 20%, the fee would be 20. As a result, the liquidator ends up with a value of 80, leading to a loss.

According to the README, which states that “Liquidation Fee = 0 (Might be increased to 20-30% in the future),” so the fee should be applied to the profit, not the collateral amount.

Of course, some may argue that the issue could be fixed by having the admin set a smaller liquidation fee. However, this doesn’t truly solve the problem.

For example, if the liquidation fee is set at 3% (which is less than the maximum possible profit of 10%), the liquidator’s profit is still dependent on the specific position. While 10% is the maximum possible profit, some liquidations may only yield a 2% profit.

Thus, even with a smaller fee, there remains a risk that the liquidator’s profit could be entirely consumed by the fee, making certain liquidations unprofitable and disincentivizing liquidators from engaging in the process.

## Impact
This could result in liquidators incurring losses or discourage anyone from becoming a liquidator.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In riskEngine.validateLiquidation, the profit margin ratio for the liquidation is calculated, and then the fee is computed as:

fee = liquidationFee * (profitMarginRatio * assetData[i].amt)

This approach correctly calculates the fee based on the profit generated from the liquidation rather than simply applying the fee to the total amount of the liquidated assets.
