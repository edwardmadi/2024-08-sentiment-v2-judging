# No one will liquidate the position if `liquidation discount` is less than `liquidation fee`

## Summary
No one will liquidate the position if `liquidation discount` is less than `liquidation fee` due to no incentives.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the liquidation mechanism in the contract allows the owner to set a liquidation fee that is higher than the liquidation discount. 
`LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` is `immutable` variable that will be set to `100000000000000000`(i.e. `10%`).
`liquidationFee` can be reset by `setLiquidationFee`. It's value can range 20-30% in the future. Currently set to `0`. 

Since liquidationFee is taken from assets seized by `liquidator`, there is no incentive for liquidator if fees are more than discount.
In `_transferAssetsToLiquidator` function:
```solidity
uint256 fee = liquidationFee.mulDiv(assetData[i].amt, 1e18);
 // transfer fee amt to protocol
Position(payable(position)).transfer(owner(), assetData[i].asset, fee);
// transfer difference to the liquidator
Position(payable(position)).transfer(msg.sender, assetData[i].asset, assetData[i].amt - fee);
``` 

## Impact
No participation of liquidators will be lead to bad debt for the protocol and since bad debt can only be liquidated by `owner`, the protocol will have lot of bad debt.
