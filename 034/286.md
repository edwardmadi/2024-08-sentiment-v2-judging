# Always enforcing a position is healthy after processing an action will cause issues

## Summary
Always enforcing a position is healthy after processing an action will cause issues
## Vulnerability Detail
After each action a user takes, we check whether the position he interacted with is healthy:
```solidity
function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```
The issue with that is that there are multiple scenarios where such a check is not necessary and might cause issues for users. For example, if the user has made their position healthier, we should still allow them to process that transaction even if it hasn't been made healthy quite yet as that is healthy for the protocol and should not be disallowed, it also makes users incur bigger losses if they do not have the option to fully repay their debt for any reason (extreme price changes, personal reasons, etc.).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not enforce the health check in all cases, for example when increasing the health of a position. However extra caution is needed to not introduce this or similar bug:
1. Frontrun liquidation and change one of your collateral tokens to another one while slightly increasing health but still below threshold
2. Liquidation fails as one of the collaterals you are getting liquidated for is not in your collateral list anymore

Thus, best option would be to have a different check regarding their health depending on the operation, in some operations require a completely healthy position, in some cases only require a healthier one.
