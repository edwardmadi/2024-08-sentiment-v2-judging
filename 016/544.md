# Borrowers will be grieved by BasePool owners by changing the initial LTV value of a new asset due to the invalid check in `requestLtvUpdate`

## Summary
PoolOwners for their pools need to update LTV  for the newly proposed collateral assets so that the borrowers can participate accordingly.
But since poolowners can change the LTV  anytime for a `newly added asset` , they can grieve the borrowers by changing to an irrational LTV since there are no timedelays mentioned for it.

## Vulnerability Detail

PoolOwner can initiallly specify a LTV for a newly added asset by calling `requestLtvUpdate()`. Here we are not adding the dime delay of `TIMELOCK_DURATION` since the ltvFor[poolId][asset] == 0.[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskEngine.sol#L181).

```solidity
        if (ltvFor[poolId][asset] == 0) ltvUpdate = LtvUpdate({ ltv: ltv, validAfter: block.timestamp });
```

Borrowers can then get tempted to borrow assets from that pool.

But `poolOwner` has the ability to call `acceptLtvUpdate()` in the same transaction by altering the previous value of `ltvFor[poolId][asset]` using `requestLtvUpdate()`.
[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskEngine.sol#L190).

Using this bug, poolOwner can change the LTV to an absurd value that results in borrowers loss.

## Impact
Borrowers will start borrowing  from the base poolOwner's pool after observing the `requestLTVUpdate` for a `newly added asset` by the `poolOwner` unaware of the fact that `poolOwner` can change and accept the new ` LTV`  as they wish ,  without any TIMELOCK in between for the borrowers to repay.

## Recommendation
if (ltvFor[poolId][asset] == 0 && ltvUpdateFor[poolId][asset].validAfter == 0)  
check instead of if (ltvFor[poolId][asset] == 0) in line #181
