# Unauthorized Access to LTV Updates

High

## Summary
The function requestLtvUpdate and acceptLtvUpdate allow the pool owner to update the Loan-to-Value(LTV) ratio for a specific pool and asset. If the pool owner's account is compromised, an attacker can set arbitrary LTV values, potentially endangering the entire pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor gains control of a pool owner's private key. The attacker sets the LTV of an asset to an extremely high value,allowing users to borrow significantly more against their collateral.

## Impact
The pool becomes under-collateralized, and if the borrowed asset drops, the protocol might suffer significant losses

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement multi-signature approval for LTV updates, requiring multiple pool owners or trusted parties to approve the change.
- Use a time-locked, decentralised governance mechanism where a proposed LTV change must go through community voting before being applied
