# Repay() assumes that owner has sent assets to Position prior to calling it

### Summary

In `repay()` the asset is assumed to be present in **Position** contract. There is no check to validate and send the asset the the **Position** contract before proceeding further. This will lead to unwanted reverts in most cases.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L361-L381` the missing `safeTransferFrom()` will lead to reverts unless user manually sends assets to **Position** contract first or the borrowed amount is still present in the **Position** contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. In order to `repay()`, User first sends x amount to **Position** contract.
2. Then User calls `repay()` in **PositionManager** contract.

### Impact

1. It doesn't maintain the atomicity of the transaction.
2. Assumption that user has transfered assets to **Position** contract in the previous call can lead to unwanted reverts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Handle the transfer of assets to Position as below:
```solidity
function repay(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
    // data -> abi.encodePacked(uint256, uint256)
    // poolId -> [0:32] pool that recieves the repaid debt
    // amt -> [32: 64] notional amount to be repaid
    uint256 poolId = uint256(bytes32(data[0:32]));
    uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[32:64]));

    // if the passed amt is type(uint).max assume repayment of the entire debt
    if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = pool.getBorrowsOf(poolId, position);

@>  uint256 existingPoolBalance = IERC20(pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId)).balanceOf(address(position));
@>  if(existingPoolBalance < amt) {
@>      IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, position, amt - existingPoolBalance);
@>  }

    // transfer assets to be repaid from the position to the given pool
    Position(payable(position)).transfer(address(pool), pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId), amt);

    // trigger pool repayment which assumes successful transfer of repaid assets
    pool.repay(poolId, position, amt);

    // signals repayment to the position and removes the debt pool if completely paid off
    // any checks needed to validate repayment must be implemented in the position
    Position(payable(position)).repay(poolId, amt);
    emit Repay(position, msg.sender, poolId, amt);
}   
```
