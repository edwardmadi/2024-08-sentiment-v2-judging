# `PUSH0` opcode Is Not Supported on Linea yet

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.24 or greater, which includes the PUSH0 opcode in the compiled bytecode. According to the README, the protocol will be deployed on the Linea network as all EVM compatible chains are mentioned.

This presents an issue because Linea does not yet support the PUSH0 opcode, which can lead to unexpected behavior or outright failures when deploying and running the smart contracts. <https://docs.linea.build/developers/quickstart/ethereum-differences#evm-opcodes>
## Impact
Deploying the protocol on Linea with the current Solidity version (0.8.24) or greater may result in unexpected behavior or failure due to the unsupported PUSH0 opcode.
