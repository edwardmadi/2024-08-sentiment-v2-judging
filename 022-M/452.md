# Changes to ```PositionManager::positionBeacon``` through  ```setBeacon``` can be reverted by anyone

### Summary

The ```PositionManager::positionBeacon``` address can be modified by the ```PositionManager``` owner to any address. Although the ```PoisionManager``` owner is trusted, the ```positionBeacon``` should only be modified through the ```registry``` to the address contained in this contract. If the owner wants to modify the ```positionBeacon```, it should be done through the ```Registry``` contract.
On top of that, if the beacon is modified through ```setBeacon```, anyone can call ```updateFromRegistry``` and overwrite it with the one contained in ```registry.addressFor(SENTIMENT_POSITION_BEACON_KEY)``` 

### Root Cause

In [PositionManager.sol::503](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L503-L506) , function ```setBeacon``` allows the PositionManager owner to set the beacon address to any address .

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Owner wants to set a new ```positionBeacon```
2. owner calls ```setBeacon``` and sets ```positionBeacon``` to an uncontrolled address putting the protocol at risk
3. On top of that, anyone can call ```updateRegistry``` and set ```positionBeacon``` to the previous address

### Impact

The ```positionManager``` owner could put the protocol at risk by setting the ```positionBeacon``` to an uncontrolled address. On top of that, even when the owner sets is to the correct address, anyone can invoke ```updateFromRegistry``` and set it to the previous address which is not the expected behavior by the protocol owner.

### PoC

Add this test to ```PositionManager.t.sol```:
```solidity
function testRevertSetBeacon() public {
        address newBeacon = makeAddr("newBeacon");
        vm.prank(positionManager.owner());
        positionManager.setBeacon(newBeacon);
        assertEq(positionManager.positionBeacon(), newBeacon, "Beacon address should be updated");

        vm.startPrank(makeAddr("nonOwner")); // Non-owner address
        positionManager.updateFromRegistry();
        assertNotEq(positionManager.positionBeacon(), newBeacon);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Remove function ```PositionManager::setBeacon``` and only allow changes to the ```positionBeacon``` to be made through ```Registry```
