# Oracle Manipulation

High

## Summary
The setOracle function allows the owner to set or change the oracle for any asset. If the owner's account is compromised or if the owner behaves maliciously, they can set a faulty or manipulated oracle 

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor sets the oracle for an asset to one that returns artificially high prices. Users borrow against the inflated collateral value, leading to under-collateralization. When true value of the collateral is realised, the protocol could be left with significant bad debt 

## Impact
If oracle inflates the value of an asset by 50%, and the pool has $10 million collateral, users could over borrow by $5 million, leading to potential losses when the actual value of the collateral is realised
