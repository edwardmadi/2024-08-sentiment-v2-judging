# User can make free borrows by swapping borrowed funds for the collateral assets inside `processBatch`

### Summary

There is an issue inside [PositionManager#processBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L238-L245) function, which may result in user borrowing funds and then swapping those funds for the collateral of the loan, which will result in free borrow for him with no personal funds.

### Root Cause

[PositionManager#processBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L238-L245) can combine multiple actions for user position and check if the position is healthy only after the loop of actions. User can borrow all funds of all pools with no collateral, use them how he wants and after that check if his position is healthy. This is a problem, because user can borrow all the liquidity of a pool, which supports token X as collateral, swap the borrowed funds for X and then use those funds as collateral for the debt. This is big problem, because by following way user don't risk a collateral and can use a large borrow to long/short an assets. If the borrowed fund decrease in price, he can withdraw collateral, which is not owned by him. If, instead loan increases in price, he don't risk being liquidated, because the collateral itself is the loan. 

Sponsor has provided [real values](https://gist.github.com/ruvaag/58c9fc2e5c139451c83c21fda27b77a2), which will be used as approved function calls for a position and authorized addresses to be approved for position tokens.
To accomplish the exploit, user can use `Pendle` router address and it's approved functions: `swapExactTokenForPt ` and `swapExactPtForToken` to swap the loan for the collateral funds, or we can chose to swap to native eth and send to receiver, which will give execution to exploiter contract, which can perform the swap and send the collateral funds to the position. Note that if the loan has a LTV of 80-90%, user will have to provide only 10-20% of personal capital to leverage the loan.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. We assume that PositionManger has approved [sponsor provided](https://gist.github.com/ruvaag/58c9fc2e5c139451c83c21fda27b77a2) addresses and functions. 

### External pre-conditions

1. We assume there is a pendle market, which underlying asset is ETH (It is supported by sponsor's list)

### Attack Path

Imagine the following scenario:
We assume a tvl of 100% for the following pool to simplify calculations. In real example, we will assume that exploiter has provided `100% - ltv` to position.

1. We have a WETH lending pool with $100K liquidity and USDC as supported collateral with 100%
2. Exploiter creates a position with USDC asset and sends 1$ PT weETH to his position.
3. He creates a malicious contract with a fallback function, which call unsiwapv3 router to swap all his balance of WETH to USDC and send the USDC to the position contract.
4. Exploiter calls `PositionManager#processBatch`:
- on the first iteration, he borrows all $100K WETH from the lending pool.
- on the second iteration he uses `Position#transfer`to send all WETH from position to the malicious contract 
- on third iteration he uses `Position#approve` to approve Peldle router for the PT weETH tokens from the beginning 
- on fourth iteration he uses `Position#exec` to call `PendleRouter#swapExactPtForToken(address,address,uint256,tuple,tuple)` providing `TokenOutput` with the address of the malicious contract and `SwapType.ETH_WETH` and he uses 1$ PT weETH from the beginning. 
- - The following will result in [swapping the pt token](https://github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core-v2-public/blob/11253615dc71191545b1f287c17a1c9c014ff7e9/contracts/router/ActionSwapPTV3.sol#L49-L62) and [sending the target](https://github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core-v2-public/blob/11253615dc71191545b1f287c17a1c9c014ff7e9/contracts/router/base/ActionBase.sol#L91-L96) contract [native funds](https://github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core-v2-public/blob/11253615dc71191545b1f287c17a1c9c014ff7e9/contracts/core/libraries/TokenHelper.sol#L23-L28), which will trigger the fallback
- - Malicious contract swap $100K WETH for $100K USDC and sends them back to the position
5. Expoiter `processBatch` exits successfully, because the position is healthy, having 100% borrow capacity 


### Impact

- Free leverage trading with large volumes without any risk
- Inflate utilization rate + interest rates 
- Reduce pool liquidity at no cost, which can result in withdraw DoS for LPs
- Increase the risk of bad debt

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Always ensure that the collateral is provided and then borrow the funds.
