# Setting Liquidation fee to 20-30% will break the protocol's liquidation function and can only work if the contract RiskModule is forked updated and redeployed

## Summary
According to the README provided - https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/349#:~:text=Liquidation%20Fee%20%3D%200%20(Might%20be%20increased%20to%2020%2D30%25%20in%20the%20future).
"Liquidation Fee = 0 (Might be increased to 20-30% in the future)".

The current implementation of the protocol allows the `liquidationFee` to be updated by the contract owner; however, the `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` is marked as immutable and lacks a corresponding update function. This limitation presents a significant issue because the protocol team has expressed plans to increase the liquidation fee to as high as 20-30%, which would require a proportional adjustment to the liquidation discount --
 Sponsor "ruvaag â€”  "the discount would also change proportionally in that case" ". 
The inability to update the `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` creates a Critical condition where liquidation becomes unprofitable to liquidators who will make no profit from liquidation and also will pay an additional 10-20% more, thus breaking the intended future functionality of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` is currently declared as an immutable variable in the contract, meaning it cannot be changed once set during contract deployment. While there is a function to update the `liquidationFee`, there is no similar mechanism to adjust the `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT`. This discrepancy is problematic because any future adjustments to the liquidation fee would necessitate corresponding changes to the liquidation discount to maintain the protocol's balance and intended functionality.

Without the ability to update the `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT`, the protocol will be unable to adapt to future requirements, rendering the contract unusable without a complete redeployment (fork) of the contract. This situation contradicts the protocol team's stated intentions and introduces a critical flaw that could prevent the contract from functioning as needed in the future.


```solidity
@audit >> This can never be updated >>> /// @notice The discount on assets when liquidating, out of 1e18
                                uint256 public immutable LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT;


```

```solidity
/// @notice Update the protocol liquidation fee
function setLiquidationFee(uint256 _liquidationFee) external onlyOwner {
    liquidationFee = _liquidationFee;
    emit LiquidationFeeSet(_liquidationFee);
}
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is substantial as it could lead to the contract becoming obsolete or dysfunctional in the future. Specifically, the inability to update the liquidation discount while allowing the liquidation fee to change creates a scenario where the protocol cannot maintain its intended functionality. This results Liquidators staying away from liquidating any position, where the protocol cannot operate as required without a costly and disruptive redeployment of the entire contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to:

1. **Remove the Immutable Label**: Change the `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT` variable to a mutable state variable. This will allow for future updates as required by the protocol's evolving needs.

2. **Implement an Update Function**: Introduce a function similar to `setLiquidationFee` that allows the contract owner to update the `LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT`. This function should include appropriate access controls to ensure only authorized updates are made.

   ```solidity
   /// @notice Update the protocol liquidation discount
   function setLiquidationDiscount(uint256 _liquidationDiscount) external onlyOwner {
       LIQUIDATION_DISCOUNT = _liquidationDiscount;
       emit LiquidationDiscountSet(_liquidationDiscount);
   }
   ```

3. **Introduce a Three-Step Update Process**: Similar to how Loan-to-Value (LTV) updates are managed, a phased approach should be considered for updating the liquidation discount. This would involve:
   - **Proposal**: The contract owner proposes a new liquidation discount.
   - **Acceptance**: A waiting period or governance approval process occurs.
   - **Finalization**: The new liquidation discount is applied.
