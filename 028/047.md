# Lack of Access Control at updateFromRegistry in RiskModule contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L61

Update Function: The updateFromRegistry function allows anyone to update the pool and riskEngine variables. This could lead to unauthorized updates if the contract is not properly secured or if an attacker can exploit it.

### Root Cause

Lack of access control

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Unauthorized updates

### PoC

### Mitigation

Need to add access control to ensure that only authorized addresses (e.g., the contract owner) can call updateFromRegistry. Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s Ownable or similar access control mechanisms.
