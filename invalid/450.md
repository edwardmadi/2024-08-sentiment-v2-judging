# _removePool overwrites removePool logic preventing pool removal from the SuperPool

### Summary

The depositQueue and the withdrawQueue, determines the pools that can be deposited and be withdrawn from, and both have a limited amount of pools that they can hold, the DOS of pool removal will prevent the economic process of the protocol, preventing the addition of pools in which economic process can take place in.

### Root Cause

In the `SuperPool::removePool` the function removes pool from the SuperPool which inturn removes them from the withdrawal and deposit queues, it also gives the caller the option the option of forceRemoval, to either fully pull out tokens from the pool before removal, as shown in [SuperPool.removePool::L326 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L326C4-L333C6)
```solidity
uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));
if (forceRemove && assetsInPool > 0) POOL.withdraw(poolId, assetsInPool, address(this), address(this));
        _removePool(poolId);
```
Here if the pool is being force removed, it withdraws and calls _removePool, as shown below in [SuperPool._removePool::L592](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L596C5-L598C1)
```solidity
 function _removePool(uint256 poolId) internal {
        if (POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this)) != 0) revert SuperPool_NonZeroPoolBalance(address(this), poolId);
```
This two snippet here show the main cause, the first function allows for optional removal, checking the POOL `getAssetOf` to know how much to remove, the internal function called requires you remove all balance, which will cause instant revert and DOS the forceRemoval--false, execution flow


### Internal pre-conditions

- Owner needs to call `removePool` with the `poolId` and `forceRemove` = false 
- The `assetsInPool` needs to be greater than zero 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Owner needs to call `removePool` with the `poolId` and `forceRemove` = false 
- The `_removePool` reverts the calls because it does not take into consideration the optional call sequence defined in `removePool`

### Impact

The depositQueue and the withdrawQueue, determines the pools that can be deposited and be withdrawn from, and both have a limited amount of pools that they can hold, the DOS of pool removal will prevent the economic process of the protocol, preventing the addition of pools in which economic process can take place in.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The `_removePool` function needs to be made aware of the `forceRemove` variable value to evaluate the process correctly
