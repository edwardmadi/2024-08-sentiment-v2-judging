# Withdraw from paused pool

## Summary
Superpool is not blocking withdraw from paused pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Superpool.withraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L281) first withdraw assets from pools as following and burns ERC20 token.
```solidity
function _withdraw(address receiver, address owner, uint256 assets, uint256 shares) internal {
        _withdrawFromPools(assets);
        if (msg.sender != owner) ERC20._spendAllowance(owner, msg.sender, shares);
        ERC20._burn(owner, shares);
        lastTotalAssets -= assets;
        ASSET.safeTransfer(receiver, assets);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner, assets, shares);
}
...
function _withdrawFromPools(uint256 assets) internal {
  ...
 try POOL.withdraw(poolId, withdrawAmt, address(this), address(this)) {
   assets -= withdrawAmt;
} catch { }
...
```
But [Pool.sol/withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L339) does not check if this pool is paused or not while deposit() checks paused condition like `if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);`
## Impact
Toggling pause function will not working properly and cause `unwanted` funds flow to attackers.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @dev Internal function to loop through all pools, withdrawing assets first from available balance
    ///     then sequentially until the cap is reached
    /// @param assets The amount of assets to withdraw
    function _withdrawFromPools(uint256 assets) internal {
        uint256 assetsInSuperpool = ASSET.balanceOf(address(this));

        if (assetsInSuperpool >= assets) return;
        else assets -= assetsInSuperpool;

        uint256 withdrawQueueLength = withdrawQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < withdrawQueueLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = withdrawQueue[i];
            // withdrawAmt -> max assets that can be withdrawn from the underlying pool
            // optimistically try to withdraw all assets from this pool
            uint256 withdrawAmt = assets;

            // withdrawAmt cannot be greater than the assets deposited by the pool in the underlying pool
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));
            if (assetsInPool < withdrawAmt) withdrawAmt = assetsInPool;

            // withdrawAmt cannot be greater than the underlying pool liquidity
            uint256 poolLiquidity = POOL.getLiquidityOf(poolId);
            if (poolLiquidity < withdrawAmt) withdrawAmt = poolLiquidity;

            if (withdrawAmt > 0) {
                try POOL.withdraw(poolId, withdrawAmt, address(this), address(this)) {
                    assets -= withdrawAmt;
                } catch { }
            }

            if (assets == 0) return;
        }

        // We explicitly check assets == 0, and if so return, otherwise we revert directly here
        revert SuperPool_NotEnoughLiquidity(address(this));
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## PoC
```solidity
    function testAudit() public {

        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(superPool)), initialDepositAmt);
        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(pool)), 0);

        testSimpleDepositIntoSuperpool();

        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(superPool)), initialDepositAmt);
        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(pool)), 100 ether);

        vm.prank(poolOwner);
        pool.togglePause(linearRatePool);

        vm.startPrank(user);
        superPool.withdraw(10 ether, user, user);

        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(superPool)), 0);
        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(address(pool)), (100 ether - (10 ether - initialDepositAmt)));
    }
```
## Recommendation
```solidity
/// @return shares Amount of shares redeemed from the pool
    function withdraw(
        uint256 poolId,
        uint256 assets,
        address receiver,
        address owner
    ) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];

        // update state to accrue interest since the last time accrue() was called
        accrue(pool, poolId);
+       if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);
```
