# The owner of a Superpool can drain the pool

## Summary
The owner of a Superpool can drain the pool
## Vulnerability Detail
Firstly, note that an owner of a Superpool is not a trusted role as everyone can create one. The owner sets a fee and a fee recipient upon deployment using `SuperPoolFactory::deploySuperPool()`. In the constructor, we have the following check which disallows the user from setting the fee percentage at more than 100%:
```solidity
if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
```
Then, at a later point, the pool owner can decide to change the fee using `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate()`:
```solidity
 function requestFeeUpdate(uint256 _fee) external onlyOwner {
        if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
        pendingFeeUpdate = PendingFeeUpdate({ fee: _fee, validAfter: block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_DURATION });
        emit SuperPoolFeeUpdateRequested(_fee);
    }
```
It creates a fee update request that can be finalized after the timelock duration is up (24 hours). In the function above, we see the following line:
```solidity
if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
```
This line is wrong as it checks the `fee` variable which is the state variable and not the provided fee input (`_fee`). This allows the pool owner to set such a fee that upon fee calculations, such an amount of shares can be minted that would allow draining of the pool.

Even though there is a time duration that has to pass before the change is finalized, 3 possible scenarios can occur which will allow the pool to be completely or partially drained:
1. A fee change is requested and almost everyone withdraws their funds during the 24 hours. However, it is pretty much guaranteed that not everyone would withdraw their funds during that time as they might be out of town, not using internet for 24 hours, simply didn't notice the change and many other possible reasons
2. People try to withdraw but a part or all of those people will not be able to as the funds deposited into different pools are all utilized and there is not enough liquidity:
```solidity
revert SuperPool_NotEnoughLiquidity(address(this));
```
3. Same scenario as the second one but with the twist that the owner of the pool maliciously borrowed enough funds from the pools and made the liquidity in those pools not enough for withdrawals. He will have to pay interest on them after the 24 hours but due to the fact that he can drain the whole Superpool, this would still be profitable

Furthermore, the pool owner can purposefully choose only pools that are with very high utilization ratio, that way the liquidity in them will be very low without him having to do anything special. On top of that, if he decides to go that route, since the utilization ratio is high, the interest APR will also be high attracting a lot of people to deposit into his Superpool.

## Recommendation
```diff
+ if (_fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
- if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
