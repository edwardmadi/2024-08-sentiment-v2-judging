# Debt repayment is blocked when `PositionManager` is paused

### Summary

`repay` function becomes unusable when the `PositionManager` contract is paused, but interest keeps accumulating. This will lead to borrowers not having ability to repay their debt if they want to. If the borrower's position is close to maximum threshold while the PositionManager is paused the position may be liquidated.


### Root Cause

`process` function in `PositionManager` contract deals with  various actions like paying off debts, has a `whenNotPaused` modifier to protect it. This broad use of the pause feature stops people from paying back what they owe when the contract is on hold. At the same time, interest keeps building up on existing loans.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `PositionManager` contract has a pause mechanism implemented.
2. The process function is the sole entry point for actions like debt repayment.
3. The process function is using `whenNotPaused` modifier.
4. Interest accrual on loans is not affected by the contract's paused state.

### External pre-conditions

 - The `PositionManager` contract is in a paused state
 - Borrowers have outstanding loans with accruing interest

### Attack Path

1. The `PositionManager` contract is paused, potentially due to a security concern or system upgrade.
2. A borrower attempts to repay their loan by calling the `process` function with a repayment action.
3. The `whenNotPaused` modifier on the process function causes the transaction to revert.
4. The borrower is unable to repay their debt.
5. Interest continues to accrue on the borrower's loan, potentially pushing them closer to liquidation thresholds.

### Impact

- Borrowers are unable to reduce their debt exposure when the contract is paused
- Interest continues to accumulate on existing loans during the pause period, increasing borrower debt without the ability to repay
- Borrowers may face increased risk of liquidation if the pause extends for a significant period


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement a different pausing mechanism that allows critical functions like debt repayment to operate even when the contract is paused. One example is to create separate `repay` function which is not affected by `whenNotPaused` modifier.
- If full pausing is necessary for security reasons, implement a mechanism to freeze interest accrual during the paused state to prevent unfair accumulation of debt
