# Users will not be able to increase their position health whenever the PositionManager is paused

## Summary
Users will not be able to increase their position health whenever the `PositionManager` is paused
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever a user wants to interact with the `PositionManager`, he has to go through one of the 2 entry points - `process()` or `processBatch()`. Then, we call the internal `_process()` function which calls the according internal function based on the action requested by the user. 

The issue is that both of those entry points have the `whenNotPaused` modifier:
```solidity
function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused
function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
```
Thus, when the protocol is paused, users will not be able to increase their position health by adding a new token or depositing. Furthermore, liquidations are not disabled when paused:
```solidity
    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
```
This means that when the contract is paused, you can still get liquidated but you can not do anything about it. 

Note that a similar issue was reported in their most recent audit and it was marked as resolved however albeit a little bit different, the issue is still here.

## Recommendation
Apply the `whenNotPaused` modifier only on specific functions, not on the entry points.
