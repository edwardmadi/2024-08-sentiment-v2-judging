# Repayments can be paused while Liquidations are enabled

## Summary
Repayments for borrower positions can be made by calling `process` or `processBatch` with the position and the action in the `positionManager` this function is however subject to pausability due to the `whenNotPaused` modifier , so it cannot be called when the contract is paused. Liquidations which can be done by bots however, are always enabled, hence the contract can be in a state where users are not allowed to repay debts that can be liquidated. This is a universal invariant across several lending protocols.

## Vulnerability Detail
Repayments for positions can be made by calling `process`, this function is however subject to pausability as is seen below

Liquidations which can be done by bots however, are always enabled, hence the contract can be in a state where borrowers cannot settle their debts but can be liquidated.

## Impact
This will prevent Borrowers from making repayments while allowing them to be unfairly liquidated by bots or other protocol users and they lose their collateral


## Code Snippet
Borrowers can repay their debts by calling, before they are unhealthy so as to avoid being liquidated
1. Process() 
2. ProcessBatch()
cannot be called to repay borrows when contract is paused.

But liquidations can always be called

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If repayments are paused then liquidations must also be paused at the same time to prevent the protocol from being in a state where borrowers collateral are forcibly seized when they are not given the chance to salvage their positions.
Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `Liquidate` function too
