# User's positions will be unfairly liquidated

## Summary
Due to the wrong fix applied to `PositionManager.sol`, users may face unfair liquidation as they cannot stabilize positions when the protocol is paused, while liquidators can still act.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `PositionManager.sol`, there are [two entry points](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L229-L246) for users to interact with their positions:
```solidity
    function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }

    function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // loop over actions and process them sequentially based on operation
        uint256 actionsLength = actions.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < actionsLength; ++i) {
            _process(position, actions[i]);
        }
        // after all the actions are processed, the position should be within risk thresholds
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```

As you can see, both functions are pausable, while the `liquidate` function is not:
```solidity
    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
```
 
If the protocol gets paused and a user's position becomes unhealthy, they cannot add collateral to stabilize their position, while liquidators can still liquidate the position since liquidate is not pausable.

Although this issue was reported in a previous audit by GA:
> ### M-04 | Pausing The PositionManager Disables addToken
> The addToken function is paused when the PositionManager is paused. This prevents borrowers
from adding new tokens as collateral to their position, which could result in the borrowers not being
able to keep their position healthy.
> ### Recommendation
> Remove the whenNotPaused modiÔ¨Åer from the addToken function.

The fix implemented was incorrect. To address this issue, the sponsor made [this commit](https://github.com/sentimentxyz/protocol-v2/pull/267/commits/c69746014588cddb1ebafb4b03b7f234be8bf27f) which removed the `whenNotPaused` modifier from the internal function and applied it to `process` and `processBatch`, which are the main entry points for users to stabilize their positions.

The fix still won't change the fact that users will be unfairly liquidated since liquidations can happen even when the protocol is paused.

## Impact
Users could be unfairly liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Prevent liquidations from occurring when the PositionManager is paused.
```diff
    function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
-   ) external nonReentrant {
+   ) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
```

It is also recommended to add a grace period so that users have a chance to stabilize their positions before being liquidated by liquidation bots upon unpausing.
