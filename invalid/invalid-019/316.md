# The issue where pausing the PositionManager disables the addToken function has not been resolved.



## Summary
The issue where pausing the PositionManager disables the addToken function has not been resolved.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
@>>   function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }

    /// @notice Procces a batch of actions on a given position
    /// @dev only one position can be operated on in one txn, including creation
    /// @param position Position address
    /// @param actions List of actions to process
@>>    function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // loop over actions and process them sequentially based on operation
        uint256 actionsLength = actions.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < actionsLength; ++i) {
            _process(position, actions[i]);
        }
        // after all the actions are processed, the position should be within risk thresholds
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```
The addToken and repay operations are both encapsulated within the _process() function. Therefore, when the PositionManager is paused, these operations are also paused.
This prevents borrowers from adding new tokens as collateral to their position, which could result in the borrowers not being able to keep their position healthy.
```javascript
function liquidate(
        address position,
        DebtData[] calldata debtData,
        AssetData[] calldata assetData
    ) external nonReentrant {
        riskEngine.validateLiquidation(position, debtData, assetData);

        // liquidate
        _transferAssetsToLiquidator(position, assetData);
        _repayPositionDebt(position, debtData);

        // position should be within risk thresholds after liquidation
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
        emit Liquidation(position, msg.sender, ownerOf[position]);
    }
```
However, the liquidation function is not paused, which could potentially lead to usersâ€™ positions being liquidated while the PositionManager is paused.
## Impact
The addToken function is paused when the PositionManager is paused. This prevents borrowers
from adding new tokens as collateral to their position, which could result in the borrowers not being able to keep their position healthy.

## Recommendation
Remove the whenNotPaused modifier from the  function of keeping their position healthy
