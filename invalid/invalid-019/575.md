# `whenNotPaused` modifier on `process` function pauses every functionality deviating from the expected pause control

## Summary
`whenNotPaused` modifier on `process` function pauses every functionality deviating from the expected pause control

## Vulnerability Detail
Following the previous audit, the `whenNotPaused` modifier was applied on the `process` and `processBatch` functions instead of the individual functions

```solidity
    function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }

    
    function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
```

This was marked as a resolve the issue `M-04 | Pausing The PositionManager Disables addToken` in the [previous audit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/audits/sentiment_v2_guardian.pdf) which states that `addToken` functionality being paused could disallow the user's to improve their position. Even after the updated code, the vulnerability is still present and even to a greater extent since now all functionality except liquidation cannot be performed during a pause
 
## Impact
Unintended functions will be paused. This includes `addToken`, `repay` etc.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move back the pausing functionality to respective internal functions instead and correct the mistake by only applying the pause modifier to required functions
