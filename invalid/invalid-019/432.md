# H-2 : Unfair Liquidation of Position

## Summary
Lending and Borrowing platform should never be able to enter a state where `"Repayments are Paused! and Liquidations enabled''
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `PositionManager` contract, the  `PositionManager::processBatch` function processes multiple actions on a given position. However, due to the  `PositionManager::whenNotPaused` modifier, this function cannot be called when the protocol is paused. This restriction applies to all actions, including critical ones such as `Repay` and `Deposit`. When the protocol is paused, users cannot repay their loans or add collateral to their positions. At the same time, the  `PositionManager::liquidation` function may still be active. This creates a situation where users are unable to protect their positions from being forcibly liquidated, leading to potentially unfair and unintended liquidations.
## Impact
The inability to repay loans or add collateral when the protocol is paused, while allowing liquidations to proceed, can cause users to lose their positions unfairly. This could lead to significant financial losses for users, especially during volatile market conditions when positions may need urgent adjustments. The pause mechanism, designed to protect the protocol, inadvertently increases risk for users by preventing them from taking necessary actions to maintain their positions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If Repayments are to be Paused, then Liquidations should also be Paused. Alternatively, consider never disallowing repayments so that users could maintain their positions in a healthy risk spectrum any day, and anytime.
