# Liquidations are enabled when repayments are disabled, causing borrowers to lose funds without a chance to repay

### Summary

Debt repaying can be temporary disabled by the admin of `PositionManager`, however liquidations are not disabled during this period. As a result, users' positions can accumulate more borrow interest, go above the liquidation threshold, and be liquidated, while users aren't able to repay the debts.

### Root Cause

The owner of [PositionManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L211) can disable different functions of the contract, [including repayments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L229C86-L229C99). However, while repayments are disabled liquidations are still [allowed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L430). As a result, when repayments are disabled, liquidator can liquidate any position, and borrowers won't be able to protect against that by repaying their debts. Thus, borrowers will be forced to lose their collateral.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin pauses repayment


### Impact

Positions will be forced to liquidations while their owners won't be able to repay debts to avoid liquidations.

```solidity
function testLiquidateWhenPositionManagerIsPaused() public {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset2.approve(address(positionManager), 1e18);

        // deposit 1e18 asset2, borrow 1e18 asset1
        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](4);
        (position, actions[0]) = newPosition(user, bytes32(uint256(0x123456789)));
        actions[1] = deposit(address(asset2), 1e18);
        actions[2] = addToken(address(asset2));
        actions[3] = borrow(fixedRatePool, 0.5e18);
        positionManager.processBatch(position, actions);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assertTrue(riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position));
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);

        


        //construct liquidator data
        DebtData memory debtData = DebtData({ poolId: fixedRatePool, amt: type(uint256).max });
        DebtData[] memory debts = new DebtData[](1);

        AssetData[] memory assets = new AssetData[](1);
        assets[0] = asset2Data;

        // // attempt to liquidate before price moves
        asset1.mint(liquidator, 10e18);
        vm.startPrank(liquidator);
        asset1.approve(address(positionManager), 1e18);
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(RiskModule.RiskModule_LiquidateHealthyPosition.selector, position));
        positionManager.liquidate(position, debts, assets);
        vm.stopPrank();

        FixedPriceOracle pointOneEthOracle = new FixedPriceOracle(0.99e18);
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        riskEngine.setOracle(address(asset2), address(pointOneEthOracle));
        assertFalse(riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position));
        
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        positionManager.togglePause();

        Action[] memory actions2 = new Action[](1);
        actions2[0] = deposit(address(asset2), 0.5e18);
        vm.expectRevert();
        positionManager.processBatch(position, actions2);
        vm.stopPrank();
    

        // // liquidate
        vm.startPrank(liquidator);
        asset1.approve(address(positionManager), 1e18);
        positionManager.liquidate(position, debts, assets);
        vm.stopPrank();
