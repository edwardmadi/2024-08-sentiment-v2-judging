# If position manager is paused, users won't be able to repay debt, but can be liquidated

### Summary
Every interaction that a user wants to do associated with his position, he has to use either [`process`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L229) or [`processBatch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L238) in `PositionManager`.

Currently both functions have the `whenNotPaused` modifier attached.

```solidity
 /// @notice Process a single action on a given position
    /// @param position Position address
    /// @param action Action config
    function process(address position, Action calldata action) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        _process(position, action);
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }

    /// @notice Procces a batch of actions on a given position
    /// @dev only one position can be operated on in one txn, including creation
    /// @param position Position address
    /// @param actions List of actions to process
    function processBatch(address position, Action[] calldata actions) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
        // loop over actions and process them sequentially based on operation
        uint256 actionsLength = actions.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < actionsLength; ++i) {
            _process(position, actions[i]);
        }
        // after all the actions are processed, the position should be within risk thresholds
        if (!riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position)) revert PositionManager_HealthCheckFailed(position);
    }
```

So both can only be used when the Position Manager isn't paused, this includes using `repay` effectively meaning that when the contract is paused users can't repay their loans. This is very problematic as `liquidate` and `liquidateBadDebt` can be used when the protocol is paused, which is extremely unfair for borrowers as it's impossible for them to repay their loans, effectively letting them get liquidated while they have no effect on the matter.

### Root Cause
Users can't repay their loans, but can get liquidated while the protocol is paused

### Internal pre-conditions
Th contract gets paused

### External pre-conditions
None

### Attack Path
None

### Impact
Borrowers get unfairly liquidated

### PoC
None

### Mitigation
Instead of attaching `whenNotPaused` to `process` and `processBatch`, attach them to each inidividual action of the position manager except `repay`.
