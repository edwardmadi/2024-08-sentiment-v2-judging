# Uncontrolled gas consumption in totalAssets function for SuperPool contract

### Summary

Line: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPool.sol#L184

The totalAssets function processes a batch of actions in a loop. If a large number of actions are processed, this could lead to high gas costs or even out-of-gas errors, potentially making the contract unusable.

### Root Cause

Lack of validation for for loop parameter depositQueueLength.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Denial of service through out-of-gas errors or excessive gas costs.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a limit on the number of actions that can be processed in a single transaction or optimize the loop to minimize gas usage.
