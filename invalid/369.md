# `accrue()` function is called before performing any checks or transfers.

## Summary
The `accrue()` function is called before performing any checks or transfers. This can lead to unnecessary interest accrual even if the transaction ultimately reverts due to an issue later on (like exceeding the pool cap). Ideally, you want to avoid updating state (especially related to financial calculations) until you are sure the function will succeed.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `accrue()` function is responsible for updating the pool’s interest and fee accruals, making it a critical part of the system’s financial logic. However, the placement of this function within other contract functions like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` can lead to issues if it is called prematurely. Specifically, if `accrue()` is invoked before validating critical conditions, it could result in wasted gas costs, unintended state changes, and inconsistencies if the transaction ultimately fails or reverts.
## Impact
An attacker could strategically trigger the accrual function by submitting a minimal deposit just before a large transaction is made. This could result in the large transaction accruing less interest than intended. An attacker can also repeatedly call the function with parameters that fail checks (e.g., exceeding the pool cap), each time causing interest to accrue unnecessarily. This could lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) if repeated failed calls result in skewed state updates or gas depletion.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Place the `accrue()` call after all conditions and checks have passed.
