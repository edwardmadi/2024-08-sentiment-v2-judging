# `feeRecipient` can borrow without incurring the fee

## Summary
`feeRecipient` can borrow without incurring the fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `borrow()` function, the protocol transfers the fee to the `feeRecipient`.

```solidity
   address asset = pool.asset;
   if (fee > 0) IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, fee);

```

 This means that the `feeRecipient` can borrow without incurring the fee. 
## Impact
`feeRecipient` can borrow without incurring the fee.
