# Attacker will cause Denial of Service (DoS) by spamming zero-amount transactions across multiple functions

### Summary

The missing zero amount checks in multiple functions of `ERC6909.sol` will cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for the Sentiment V2 protocol as an attacker will spam zero amount transactions across functions like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance`.

### Root Cause

In `ERC6909.sol:32,42,57,63,69`, there are missing checks to prevent zero-amount transactions in the following functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to deploy the `Pool` contract derived from `ERC6909`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `transfer()` with `amount` set to 0.
2. The attacker calls `transferFrom()` with `amount` set to 0.
3. The attacker calls `approve()` with `amount` set to 0.
4. The attacker calls `increaseAllowance()` with `amount` set to 0.
5. The attacker calls `decreaseAllowance()` with `amount` set to 0.
6. The attacker repeats these steps across all affected functions, flooding the network with zero-amount transactions.

### Impact

- The protocol cannot process legitimate transactions efficiently cause of increased gas consumption and event log clutter across multiple functions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add checks in the affected functions to prevent zero-amount transactions.
``` solidity
require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
