# Unilateral Fee Adjustment by contract owner in Pool Contracts instead of Pool Owners

## Summary
The `Pool` contract centralizes control over `interest` and `origination fees`, allowing only the contract owner to update these parameters. This may lead to potential issues related to flexibility and alignment of interests.

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `setInterestFee()` and `setOriginationFee()` are restricted to the contract owner, not the individual pool owners. This centralizes fee control, which can lead to misalignment between the protocol's overarching goals and the specific needs or strategies of individual pool owners.

## Impact
- Lack of Flexibility: Pool owners cannot adjust fees to suit their specific risk profiles or market conditions.
- Potential Misalignment: The protocol owner's decisions may not always align with the best interests of individual pool owners or users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Allow pool owners to set their own fees within certain predefined limits or with oversight from the protocol owner. This approach provides flexibility while maintaining some level of control.
- Implement maximum limits on fees to prevent potential abuse while allowing pool owners some degree of autonomy in setting fees.
