# Underflow Issue in `Pool:withdraw` Function

## Summary
There is an underflow issue in `Pool:withdraw` & `ERC6909:transferFrom` function’s allowance management logic. This underflow issue comes when `allowed` is less than `shares`. And its quite possible. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises in two ways. Firstly, when `msg.sender` is neither the owner nor an operator, and has no allowance. In such a case, the allowance is initialized to `0`, and subtracting shares from this 0 value results in an underflow, setting the allowance to a large, unintended value. In second case, if `msg.sender` is neither owner nor the operator and it does have allowance. But that is less than share which will result in underflow too. 

The current logic allows for an underflow scenario when handling allowance subtraction:

```solidity
if (msg.sender != owner && !isOperator[owner][msg.sender]) { 
    uint256 allowed = allowance[owner][msg.sender][poolId];
    if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[owner][msg.sender][poolId] = allowed - shares; // Underflow possible
}
```
In this code, if `allowed` is 0 and `shares` is greater than 0, the subtraction `allowed - shares` results in an underflow, causing the allowance to be set to an unintended large value due to Solidity’s wrap-around behavior.

## Impact
First it will revert without giving proper reason why it did it so. And it could enable malicious actors to perform operations without proper authorization, putting the contract’s integrity and funds at risk.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handle this scenario with proper error handling and ensure that `allowed` is always equal to or greater than `shares`.
