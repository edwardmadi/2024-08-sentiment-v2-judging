# Borrowers can use special LTV pairs can be used to utilize a bigger portion of their stake

## Summary
Borrowers are limited on the amount of borrowable assets by their LTV. However they can mitigate this risk, by just borrowing high LTV assets and then swapping them for their desired low LTV assets

## Vulnerability Detail
[RiskEngine](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/RiskEngine.sol#L60) limits borrowing amount by placing LTV on pool-asset pairs. Where pool A can have 90% LTV with coinA and 70% LTV with coinB. 

```solidity
    /// @notice Fetch the ltv for a given asset in a pool
    mapping(uint256 poolId => mapping(address asset => uint256 ltv)) public ltvFor;
```

This mechanic is put in place in order to protect the system from bad debt. Some assets are assigned lower LTV because they are more volatile and risky, increasing the likelihood that their price will dive and liquidators will not have enough time to liquidate all of the positing, resulting in bad debt accumulating in the system.

However users can avoided this safety feature by using [exec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L289-L304) to interact with external contract and swap away their assets.

```solidity
    /// @dev Operate on a position by interaction with external contracts using arbitrary calldata
    function exec(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        address target = address(bytes20(data[:20]));
        uint256 value = uint256(bytes32(data[20:52]));
        bytes4 funcSelector = bytes4(data[52:56]);

        if (!isKnownFunc[target][funcSelector]) revert PositionManager_UnknownFuncSelector(target, funcSelector);

        Position(payable(position)).exec(target, value, data[52:]);
        emit Exec(position, msg.sender, target, funcSelector);
    }
```

Example:
1. PoolA has 90% LTV with USDC - safer asset
2. PoolB has 60% LTV with USDC - risky asset
3. Alice wants to borrow as much as she can from poolB
4. She deposits 100k USDC and borrows 90k worth of value from poolA instead
5. She swaps her 90k of A tokens to 90k worth of B tokens

Alice essentially used 90% LTV on poolB even thought it's max was 60%.

## Impact
Borrowers pay less APR for using more risky assets.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _getMinReqAssetValue( ... ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 minReqAssetValue;

        uint256 debtPoolsLength = debtPools.length;
        uint256 positionAssetsLength = positionAssets.length;

        for (uint256 i; i < debtPoolsLength; ++i) {
            for (uint256 j; j < positionAssetsLength; ++j) {
                uint256 ltv = riskEngine.ltvFor(debtPools[i], positionAssets[j]);

                if (ltv == 0) revert RiskModule_UnsupportedAsset(position, debtPools[i], positionAssets[j]);
                minReqAssetValue += debtValuleForPool[i].mulDiv(wt[j], ltv, Math.Rounding.Up);
            }
        }

        if (minReqAssetValue == 0) revert RiskModule_ZeroMinReqAssets();
        return minReqAssetValue;
    }
```

## Recommendation
AAVE implements [siloed](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#siloed-mode) and [isolation](https://docs.aave.com/risk/asset-risk/risk-parameters#isolation-mode) mode to protect against this possibility, consider implementing the same.
