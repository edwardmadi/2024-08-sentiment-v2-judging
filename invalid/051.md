# `latestRoundData()` checks in the ChainLink oracles does not check for round completeness

## Summary

Using ChainLink oracles without accounting for round completeness can lead to using stale prices. This in turn will cause all functions that rely on these prices to operate outside of the normal behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Sentiment` utilizes the ChainLink price oracles to obtain information regarding ETH/ERC20 prices. The `latestRoundData()` method is invoked to obtain this data. Currently, only the returned price and timestamps are checked, where the round completeness check is missing.

According to [Chainlink's documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data), this function does not throw an error if no answer can be obtained but instead returns 0, or in the worst case stale data. This means that if the underlying system using these feeds does not account for all cases, there could be incorrect behavior. For example, the oracle could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. Oracle reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems. Such complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

## Impact

If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and/or finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices, wrong price return values,  and as a whole outdated data.

As a result, the functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes leads to fund loss. The impacts vary and depend on the specific situation like the following:

* incorrect liquidation
  * some users could be liquidated when they should not
  * no liquidation is performed when there should be
* wrong price feed
  * causing inappropriate loans to be taken, beyond the current collateral factor
  * too low price feed affects normal bor
