# `Pool.sol` functions are not strictly in compliance with ERC6909

## Summary
`Pool.sol` functions are not strictly in compliance with ERC6909

## Vulnerability Detail
As per the contest readme, `Pool.sol is strictly ERC6909 compliant`. `Pool.sol` has inherited base contract `ERC6909`.

```solidity
contract Pool is OwnableUpgradeable, ERC6909 {
```

ERC6909 has public functions which can be used by `Pool.sol` as its being inherited. The following implemented functions are not in strict compliance with ER6909.

```solidity
    function transfer(address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender][id] -= amount;

        balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, msg.sender, receiver, id, amount);

        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        if (msg.sender != sender && !isOperator[sender][msg.sender]) {
            uint256 allowed = allowance[sender][msg.sender][id];
            if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[sender][msg.sender][id] = allowed - amount;
        }

        balanceOf[sender][id] -= amount;

        balanceOf[receiver][id] += amount;

        emit Transfer(msg.sender, sender, receiver, id, amount);

        return true;
    }
```

As per [ERC6909 specification for `transfer()` and transferFrom()` functions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909),

 transfer
>>MUST revert when the caller’s balance for the token id is insufficient.

 transferFrom
>> MUST revert when the caller is neither the sender nor an operator for the sender and the caller’s allowance for the token id for the sender is insufficient.
>> MUST revert when the sender’s balance for the token id is insufficient.

This `MUST` requirement of ERC6909 pertaining to both `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions is not complied therefore, the functions wont be able to revert in case senders balance for the token is not enough and callers allowance for sender is not sufficient.

## Impact
Failure to comply with the ERC6909 specification for methods like transfer and transferFrom which is a considered as strict compliance by protocol

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure `Pool.sol` is in strict compliance with ERC6909.

Consider below changes:
```diff
+    /// @dev Thrown when owner balance for id is insufficient.
+    /// @param owner The address of the owner.
+    /// @param id The id of the token.
+    error InsufficientBalance(address owner, uint256 id);

+    /// @dev Thrown when spender allowance for id is insufficient.
+    /// @param spender The address of the spender.
+    /// @param id The id of the token.
+    error InsufficientPermission(address spender, uint256 id);

        }
