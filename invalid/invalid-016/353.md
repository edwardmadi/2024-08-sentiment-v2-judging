# Handle Fee-on-transfer for USDT

## Summary
As per contest readme protocol only supports standard ERC-20 tokens (plus USDC/USDT) And do not support fee on transfer on tokens. USDT has an optional fee-on-transfer mechanism, meaning it can charge a fee when transferring tokens. Below is the current implementation and how we can handle the fee-on-transfer scenario:

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the existing implementation of the USDT `transferFrom` function, which does not currently account for fee-on-transfer:
```solidity
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(3 * 32) {
        var _allowance = allowed[_from][msg.sender];

        // Check is not needed because sub(_allowance, _value) will already throw if this condition is not met
        // if (_value > _allowance) throw;

@>      uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);
        if (fee > maximumFee) {
            fee = maximumFee;
        }
        if (_allowance < MAX_UINT) {
            allowed[_from][msg.sender] = _allowance.sub(_value);
        }
        uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
        balances[_from] = balances[_from].sub(_value);
        balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(sendAmount);
        if (fee > 0) {
            balances[owner] = balances[owner].add(fee);
            Transfer(_from, owner, fee);
        }
        Transfer(_from, _to, sendAmount);
    }
```
Currently, the USDT contract has set the fee to 0 , meaning they won't charge a fee now, but they have the option to charge a fee in the future.
For that they have `setParams` function to change fee any time.
The USDT contract includes parameters to set fees if necessary:

```solidity
// Additional variables for use if transaction fees ever become necessary
uint public basisPointsRate = 0;
uint public maximumFee = 0;

function setParams(uint newBasisPoints, uint newMaxFee) public onlyOwner {
 // Ensure transparency by hardcoding limit beyond which fees can never be added
 require(newBasisPoints < 20);
 require(newMaxFee < 50);
 basisPointsRate = newBasisPoints;
 maximumFee = newMaxFee.mul(10**decimals);
 emit Params(basisPointsRate, maximumFee);
}
```
If USDT decides to set a fee, the pool will receive fewer tokens than expected (i.e., amount minus fees). This will result in minting extra shares to the user.
Like you can see in below `pool::deposit()` It is not handling USDT fee on transfer case.
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 poolId, uint256 assets, address receiver) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId]; //getting pool struct

        if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);

      
        accrue(pool, poolId);

    @>    IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets); 
        if (pool.totalDepositAssets + assets > pool.poolCap) revert Pool_PoolCapExceeded(poolId);

     
    @>    shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroSharesDeposit(poolId, assets);

    @>    pool.totalDepositAssets += assets;
    @>    pool.totalDepositShares += shares;

        _mint(receiver, poolId, shares); //minting shres to recivers for particular pool

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```

## Impact
If USDT implements the fee on transfer which that they can do in future than this will break the protocol invariant.
And when user withdraws against it shares it will get more amount than it's deposit because pool get the deposit amount - fee but deposit function is not accounting this.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To handle the potential fee-on-transfer scenario, the `pool::deposit` function should be modified as follows:
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 poolId, uint256 assets, address receiver) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId]; //getting pool struct

        if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);

      
        accrue(pool, poolId);

        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(pool.asset).balanceOf(address(this));

    @>  IERC20(pool.asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets); 
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(pool.asset).balanceOf(address(this));
        assets = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;

        if (pool.totalDepositAssets + assets > pool.poolCap) revert Pool_PoolCapExceeded(poolId);
     
    @>    shares = _convertToShares(assets, pool.totalDepositAssets, pool.totalDepositShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroSharesDeposit(poolId, assets);

    @>    pool.totalDepositAssets += assets;
    @>    pool.totalDepositShares += shares;

        _mint(receiver, poolId, shares); //minting shres to recivers for particular pool

        emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
    }
```
