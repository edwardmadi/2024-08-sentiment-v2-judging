# Missing `receiver` Validation in the `deposit` Function

## Reference
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L309
## Summary
The `deposit` function in the Pool contract does not include validation for the receiver parameter. If a user mistakenly or maliciously passes the zero address as the `receiver`, the function will proceed to mint deposit shares to the zero address, causing irreversible loss of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no validation to check if the `receiver` is the zero address (address(0)). If the zero address is passed, shares are minted to this address, making it impossible to retrieve the funds. This leads to the following potential issues:
- Once shares are minted to the zero address, they cannot be recovered, resulting in a complete loss of the corresponding assets.
- Users might accidentally lose funds if they unknowingly input the zero address, creating a poor user experience and financial risk.
## Impact
It directly leads to irreversible loss of funds and opens up attack vectors that could be exploited maliciously.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a validation check to ensure that the receiver is not the zero address.
