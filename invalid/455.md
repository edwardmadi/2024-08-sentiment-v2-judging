# SuperPool::removePool() function will ALWAYS revert if `forceRemove = true` & anyone borrows from the given Base pool OR totalBorrowAssets > 0.

## Summary
`SuperPool::removePool()` function which is used for removing a Base pool from Super pool, if forceRemove expected, will always revert if anyone borrows from the base pool, i.e if `pool.totalBorrowAssets > 0`, SINCE, while removing, it is expected to withdraw all assets being deposited by SuperPool in the given BasePool, which won't be able to happen, since some assets would be borrowed and hence max withdrawable amount of assets will be less than all assets amount deposited, hence WILL always revert, which breaks the functionality and would not make it possible to remove a Base Pool (if present)from SuperPool , until unless all users repay the debt amounts, which would not be in hands of protocol's.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `removePool` function  :

```javascript
function removePool(uint256 poolId, bool forceRemove) external onlyOwner {
        if (poolCapFor[poolId] == 0) return; // no op if pool is not in queue
        uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));
        if (forceRemove && assetsInPool > 0) POOL.withdraw(poolId, assetsInPool, address(this), address(this));
        _removePool(poolId);
        poolCapFor[poolId] = 0;
        emit PoolCapSet(poolId, 0);
    }
```

If `forceRemove` is being set to `True`, then the withdraw function is being called in the (Base) Pool contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L339-L372

The `assetsInPool` parameter is being passed, which is returned value calculated using `POOL.getAssetsOf`, in which the `balanceOf[address(superPool)][id]` ( i.e the amount of shares SuperPool contract has, which were being minted while supplying to the base pools and depositing assets in them using `_supplyPools` internal function call made in `_deposit` function)  is being used.

So lets say using `SuperPool.deposit()` , 100 units of assets are being deposited, and for simplicity there is a single pool added.
Hence 100 shares will be minted to the SuperPool contract in the POOL.deposit() function call.

So the  `POOL.getAssetsOf`, function will return value 100 units.

Now , further moving in `SuperPool::removePool` function, it will call `POOL.withdraw` function with the assetInPool value equal to 100 units.

Now the issue is :

In the `Pool.withdraw function`, `maxWithdrawAssets` is being calculated.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L359C4-L362C118

If anyone borrows from this Pool, then pool.totalBorrowAssets will be greater than 0.
And here the totalBalance (assets in Pool) will be equal to 100 units, as they were being supplied by the SuperPool itself.

Hence  `maxWithdrawAssets` will be less than 100.

lets say someone borrows 10 units of assets, then `maxWithdrawAssets` = 90.

Which is less than the `POOL.getAssetsOf` value of SuperPool, which was being passed as parameter while calling `POOL.withdraw`.
i.e `assets = 100`, & `maxWithdrawAssets = 90`.

And hence because of the below check : 

```javascript
if (maxWithdrawAssets < assets) revert Pool_InsufficientWithdrawLiquidity(poolId, maxWithdrawAssets, assets);
```

This function call will always revert.
This is because while removing it is being expected to withdraw all assets. But if anyone would have borrowed it, then all the assets would not be able to be withdrawn, and hence the `removePool` function call will always revert.

## Impact
`SuperPool::removePool()` function call will always revert if anyone borrow if 1 unit of asset.

Because of which if SuperPool owner would have to remove the given pool due to any reason, he won't be able to remove it , until unless all borrow amounts are being repayed, which would be based on users only, and can't be in hands of protocol.

## POC (Proof Of Concept)

For describing the same scenario above, below gist file contains the proof of code.
It required both use of SuperPool.t.sol & PositionManager.t.sol functionalities, hence made a different test contract.
Directly add this in `test/core folder`

GIST FILE : https://gist.github.com/Pranay-Bhilare/b6aba8e01ef9e7e0045a3941ffc88579

And run using command 

`forge test --mt testRemovePoolReverts -vvvv ` 

This will give the following console output : 

`Ran 1 test for test/core/test.t.sol:POCTest
[PASS] testRemovePoolReverts() (gas: 1020620)
Traces:`

And in the Traces at the end you can see : 

` [Revert] Pool_InsufficientWithdrawLiquidity(76185170914664034982717614324376362661771448584651785366001810948719059386837 [7.618e76], 90000000000000000000 [9e19], 100000000000000000000 [1e20])

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The Pool data should be fetched first, and if there are any borrowed assets, that value should be subtracted first from the `assetInPool` value, which will THEN be equal to the `maxWithdrawAssets` and then it should be passed as parameter while calling POOL.withdraw() function.

This will prevent reverting, and maximum assets will be retrieved back SAFELY.
