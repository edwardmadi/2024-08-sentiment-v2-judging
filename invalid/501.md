## Summary
The liquidation process involves multiple external calls to oracle pool, and others contracts without a proper reentrancy guard. This opens the contract to a reentrancy attack during liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor could exploit this by re-entering the contract during the liquidation process, manipulating assets and debt values to unfairly seize assets or avoid debt repayments.

## Impact
Manipulation of assets and debt values to unfairly seize assets or avoid debt repayments
