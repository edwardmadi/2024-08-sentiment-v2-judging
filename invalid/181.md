# Attacker can open many small positions, disincentivizing liquidations

### Summary

A `minDebt = 0` open the doors for attackers to open many small positions.  Small underwater positions have no incentive for liquidators to liquidate them given the gas cost.



### Root Cause

According with the [updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/commit/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5) contest Readme file the project consider having a `minDebt` and/or `minBorrow` from `0 to 0.05ETH`. 
Since the contracts can be deployed to any EVM compatible chain, including Ethereum L1, gas fees can increase dramatically, making liquidating small positions not economically viably.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. `minDebt` / `minBorrow`  equal to 0 or small amount (eg. 0.01 eth);

### External pre-conditions

1. L1 gas price must be relatively high, but depends by `minDebt` value. Check Attack Path for a detailed explanation.

### Attack Path

Let's take current numbers at the time of writing this report to get an idea how viable is having `minDebt = 0` on Ethereum L1 from the liquidations profitability perspective. 
- gas price = 20 gwei
- liquidation bonus = 1e17 = 10%
- median `liquidate` gas cost : 142_229 

Note: foundry's `forge test --gas-report` was used to get the `liquidate` gas cost. Even if maybe not 100% precise I think it's a good way to make an idea of how much fees must be paid to call liquidate function. 
You can add `gas_reports = ["PositionManager"]` in `foundry.toml` to generate the gas cost table only for `PositionManager` contract. 

| Function Name                                    | min             | avg    | median | max    | # calls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| liquidate                                        | 126791          | 195931 | 142229 | 318775 | 3       |


To call `liquidate` would cost 20gwei * 142_229 = 2_844_580 gwei ~= 0.00284 Ether.
This means that: 
`assetSeized - debtRepaid = 0.00284` to not lose money. 

According to [formula](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L156) used in `_validateSeizedAssetValue` : 
`uint256 maxSeizedAssetValue = debtRepaidValue.mulDiv(1e18, (1e18 - discount));`

`maxSeized = debtRepaid * 1e18 / (1e18 - 1e17) ` <=> 
`maxSeized = debtRepaid * 10 / 9`

Supposing `assetSeized = maxSeized`:
`debtRepaid * 10 / 9  - debtRepaid = 0.00284` => 
`debtRepaid = 0.00284 * 9  = 0.0255`

Liquidator need to liquidate a position with at least 0.0255 Eth in debt to not lose money. 
Keep in mind that the best case scenario was chosen regarding `liquidate` gas cost and a gas price of 20gwei. 
Gas price can increase sharply when network is heavily used making liquidations less profitable. By example in 05 May 2023 median gas price reached 142gwei.

An attacker can open many small positions which will go underwater as they accrue interest (or due to collateral price fluctuations). Since liquidators are not incentivized to liquidate them, the protocol will acumulate bad debt. 

### Impact

Small positions makes liquidations not profitable and protocol will acumulate bad debt. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider keeping a `minDebt` > 0. Moreover a more detailed analysis is required to calculate the `minDebt` depending on gas price on each chain protocol will be deployed to.
