# Missing Validation of Stale Price Threshold Relative to Chainlink Feed Heartbeat In `ChainlinkEthOracle::setFeed` Function

## Description
In the setFeed function, there is no validation to ensure that the stalePriceThreshold parameter is set to a value that is equal to or greater than the heartbeat of the Chainlink feed. The stalePriceThreshold defines the maximum duration that a price is considered valid, while the heartbeat represents the maximum interval at which Chainlink guarantees a price update. If the stalePriceThreshold is set to a value lower than the feed’s heartbeat, fresh price data might be flagged as stale, which could result in valid price feeds being ignored by the system. This could unnecessarily trigger failsafe mechanisms or revert transactions.

## Impact
Setting the stalePriceThreshold below the feed’s heartbeat could lead to the protocol rejecting valid price data, potentially causing disruptions in price-dependent functions, such as liquidations, collateral evaluations, and overall system stability. This misconfiguration could cause the system to behave incorrectly, reverting transactions, or triggering unnecessary safety mechanisms, negatively affecting protocol operatio


## Recommended 
 Introduce a validation check that ensures the stalePriceThreshold is always greater than or equal to the feed’s heartbeat. This will prevent fresh prices from being incorrectly marked as stale and avoid unnecessary system disruptions.
