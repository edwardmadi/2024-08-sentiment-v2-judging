# Protocol pool fees are not enforeced

### Summary

As per an old audit, the issue where fees on `Pool.sol` that can be initialized by anyone that wants to create a pool can be set to 0, which makes no economic sense for pool owners to set it anything else.

The issue has been marked as resolved but it can be clearly seen, that is not been resolved by the protocol.

### Root Cause

There are missing check for `defaultInterestFee_` and `defaultOriginationFee_` in the `initialize` function.

The issue can be seen, marked as resolved in the audit made by GuardianAudits: H-03 | Fees are like Donations.
