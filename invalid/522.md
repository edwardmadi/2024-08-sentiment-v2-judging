# Unlimited Deposit Queue Expansion

Medium 

## Summary
The depositQueue and withdrawQueue are limited by the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH, but a failure to enforce these limits rigorously could allow attackers to exceed this limit, leading to unpredictable behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker could exploit a race condition or minor code oversight to exceed the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH. This could disrupt the intended queuing mechanism and potentially prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract.

## Impact
Disruption of operations, leading to partial or complete denial of service for depositors and withdrawals.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add comprehensive checks to all queue-modifying functions to ensure that the MAX_QUEUE_LENGTH is strictly enforced.
