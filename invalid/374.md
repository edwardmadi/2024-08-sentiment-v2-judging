# users can incur debt when borrowing without actually receiving their borrowed tokens.

## Summary
Users can incur debt when borrowing without actually receiving their borrowed tokens. This will only occur when `owner` sets `originationFee` at max

## Vulnerability Detail
 The `Pool` contract allows the `owner` to set the `OriginationFee` up to `1e18`. When the originationFee is set to this maximum value,  it implies that `fee == amt * 1` [because](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L465).
Thus `zero` assets  would be sent to the position during transfer as indicated  [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L472).  Consequently, the entire borrowed amount is taken as the fee, leaving the borrower with no assets sent to the position while still incurring [debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L461).

## Impact
Users can be left in a vulnerable state where they have borrowed funds but do not receive any assets in return due to the fee structure, effectively putting them into debt without gaining any assets. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function test_borrow_fails_to_add_position() public {
        vm.startPrank(protocolOwner);
        pool.setOriginationFee(fixedRatePool, 1e18);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset2.approve(address(positionManager), 3e18);
        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](5);
        (position, actions[0]) = newPosition(user, bytes32(uint256(0x123456789)));
        actions[1] = deposit(address(asset2), 3e18);
        actions[2] = addToken(address(asset2));
        actions[3] = borrow(fixedRatePool, 1 ether);
        actions[4] = addToken(address(asset3));
        positionManager.processBatch(position, actions);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assertTrue(riskEngine.isPositionHealthy(position));

        (uint256 totalAssetValue, uint256 totalDebtValue, ) = riskEngine.getRiskData(position);

        assertEq(totalAssetValue, 3e18);
        assertEq(totalDebtValue, 1 ether);
        assert(asset1.balanceOf(address(position)) == 0);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent this issue, modify the setOriginationFee function to enforce an upper limit on the originationFee.
 ```solidity
  function setOriginationFee(uint256 poolId, uint128 originationFee) external onlyOwner {
        if (originationFee => 1e18) revert Pool_FeeTooHigh();
        poolDataFor[poolId].originationFee = originationFee;
        emit OriginationFeeSet(poolId, originationFee);
    }
```
