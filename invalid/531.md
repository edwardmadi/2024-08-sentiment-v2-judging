# Reward tokens from external protocols, such as GMX, are not accurately accounted for

## Summary

If the position owner stakes position assets in the GMX protocol, rewards will accrue for that position. However, when assessing the health of the position, unclaimed rewards are not considered part of the position's assets. This oversight could lead to illegitimate liquidations. Additionally, if the reward tokens are not classified as `knownAsset`, the position owner cannot transfer these tokens, as transferring position assets requires them to be `knownAsset`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Position owners can stake their assets in the GMX protocol. When assets are staked, corresponding rewards accrue for the position, and the owners can claim these rewards (see [allowed function list](https://gist.github.com/ruvaag/58c9fc2e5c139451c83c21fda27b77a2)). However, the protocol does not accurately account for the rewards from GMX as part of the position assets.

1. If the reward tokens are not classified as `knownAsset`, the position owner can't transfer the rewards that arrived at the position, as transferring requires tokens to be `knownAsset`. As a result, the rewards remain inaccessible.
    ```solidity
        function transfer(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
            // data -> abi.encodePacked(address, address, uint256)
            // recipient -> [0:20] address that will receive the transferred tokens
            // asset -> [20:40] address of token to be transferred
            // amt -> [40:72] amount of asset to be transferred
            address recipient = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
            address asset = address(bytes20(data[20:40]));
            uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[40:72]));

    316     if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_TransferUnknownAsset(asset);

            // if the passed amt is type(uint).max assume transfer of the entire balance
            if (amt == type(uint256).max) amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);

            Position(payable(position)).transfer(recipient, asset, amt);
            emit Transfer(position, msg.sender, recipient, asset, amt);
        }
    ```

2. Even if the reward tokens are classified as `knownAsset`, the health check does not include unclaimed rewards as part of the position's assets.

    In the [RiskModule.isPositionHealthy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L67-L85) function, unclaimed rewards are not factored into the position's health assessment. This oversight could lead to unfair liquidations, even when the position owner could avoid liquidation by claiming rewards to increase the position's asset value. Furthermore, after liquidation, all position assets, including the staked tokens in the GMX protocol, are sent to the liquidator, allowing them to claim rewards that should rightfully belong to the position owner.

## Impact

1. If the reward tokens from the GMX protocol are not classified as `knownAsset`, the position owner cannot transfer them.
2. Even if the reward tokens are classified as `knownAsset`, positions may be unfairly liquidated because unclaimed rewards are not included in the position's asset calculations.

## Recommendation

The protocol should include the rewards from the GMX protocol as part of the position's assets.
