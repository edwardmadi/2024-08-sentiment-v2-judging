# Pool owners can drain their pools and accrue bad debt to the lenders

## Summary
Pool owners can drain their pools and accrue bad debt to the lenders.

## Vulnerability Detail
LTV updates on already set values can be changed in an instant.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/RiskEngine.sol#L167-L187
```solidity
    function requestLtvUpdate(uint256 poolId, address asset, uint256 ltv) external {
        if (msg.sender != pool.ownerOf(poolId)) revert RiskEngine_OnlyPoolOwner(poolId, msg.sender);

        if (oracleFor[asset] == address(0)) revert RiskEngine_NoOracleFound(asset);
        if (ltv < minLtv || ltv > maxLtv) revert RiskEngine_LtvLimitBreached(ltv);

        if (pool.getPoolAssetFor(poolId) == asset) revert RiskEngine_CannotBorrowPoolAsset(poolId);

        LtvUpdate memory ltvUpdate;
        if (ltvFor[poolId][asset] == 0) ltvUpdate = LtvUpdate({ ltv: ltv, validAfter: block.timestamp });
        else ltvUpdate = LtvUpdate({ ltv: ltv, validAfter: block.timestamp + TIMELOCK_DURATION });

        ltvUpdateFor[poolId][asset] = ltvUpdate;

        emit LtvUpdateRequested(poolId, asset, ltvUpdate);
    }
```

This will enable a pool owner to set some risky asset to 98% TVL in an instant TX. While at the same time using it as collateral and borrowing as much as he can from his pool. The risky asset can change it's price quickly and cause his position to be liquidated, potentially causing bad debt to the system.

## Impact
Loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
Provided above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Impose delays for LTV updates, no matter if it's an owner is adding a new asset or changing the LTV of an old one.
