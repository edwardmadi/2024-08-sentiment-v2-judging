# Unsupported asset exploitation allows positions to maintain Unhealthy Leverage

### Summary

The lack of dynamic checks in [RiskModule.sol#L264-L267](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L264-L267) for asset support status will cause an inaccurate risk assessment for the protocol and its stakeholders, as a malicious position holder will exploit outdated LTV values to maintain unhealthy leverage and avoid necessary liquidations. This impacts the `isPositionHealthy` function by misrepresenting position health and the `getRiskData` function by providing misleading risk data.


The check for `ltv == 0` is intended to catch unsupported assets. However, this check only occurs when calculating the minimum required asset value, and it assumes that the LTV values are always up-to-date.
```solidity
               uint256 ltv = riskEngine.ltvFor(debtPools[i], positionAssets[j]);

                // revert with pool id and the asset that is not supported by the pool
                if (ltv == 0) revert RiskModule_UnsupportedAsset(position, debtPools[i], positionAssets[j]);
```                


### Root Cause

In [RiskModule.sol#L264-L267](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/RiskModule.sol#L264-L267), the `_getMinReqAssetValue` function lacks dynamic verification of asset support status, relying on potentially outdated LTV values. This oversight can lead to incorrect risk assessments in the `isPositionHealthy` and `getRiskData` functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract uses LTV values that are not dynamically updated to reflect changes in asset support status. This static nature is a pre-condition for the vulnerability, as it allows outdated LTV values to be used in calculations.


### External pre-conditions

system allows for the support status of assets to change dynamically. This means that an asset can become unsupported after being initially supported, which is critical for the vulnerability to be exploited.

### Attack Path


1. Malicious Position Holder adds an asset to their position that is initially supported by the pool.
2. The asset's support status changes externally, and it becomes unsupported. However, the contract does not dynamically update the LTV values to reflect this change.
3. The position holder calls the `isPositionHealthy` function. Due to the unchanged LTV values, the function incorrectly assesses the position as healthy, allowing the position holder to avoid liquidation despite the asset being unsupported.
4. The position holder continues to maintain or even increase leverage, exploiting the incorrect health assessment to borrow more than they should be allowed.
5. Call `getRiskData` to assess the risk profile of the position. Due to the unchanged LTV values, the function provides inaccurate risk data, misleading stakeholders about the true risk associated with the position.

The absence of dynamic verification for asset support status in the `_getMinReqAssetValue` function allows the position holder to exploit outdated LTV values. 

This results in incorrect assessments of position health and risk data, enabling the maintenance of unhealthy leverage and potentially leading to systemic risk. 

### Impact

The protocol and its stakeholders suffer from loss of funds due to inaccurate risk assessments. The attacker gains the ability to exploit outdated LTV values, allowing them to maintain excessive leverage and avoid necessary liquidations. This can lead to systemic risk, and potential losses for the protocol if multiple positions exploit this vulnerability.


### Mitigation

- Implement real-time checks to ensure LTV values reflect current asset support status during risk assessments.
