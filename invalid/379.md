# Unauthorized access to `RedstoneCoreOracle::UpdatePrice`, leading to financial losses for systems relying on the Oracle

### Summary

The lack of access control in the `updatePrice()` function will cause potential financial losses for systems relying on the oracle, as unauthorized actors can manipulate price data by calling the function with altered inputs.
- [RedstoneOracle.sol#L48](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/oracle/RedstoneOracle.sol#L48)


### Root Cause

In the  [RedstoneOracle.sol#L48](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/0b472f4bffdb2c7432a5d21f1636139cc01561a5/protocol-v2/src/oracle/RedstoneOracle.sol#L48), the `updatePrice()` function lacks access control, allowing unauthorized actors to call it and potentially manipulate price data. 
```solidity
function updatePrice() external {
        // values[0] -> price of ASSET/USD
        // values[1] -> price of ETH/USD
        // values are scaled to 8 decimals
        uint256[] memory values = getOracleNumericValuesFromTxMsg(dataFeedIds);

        assetUsdPrice = values[0];
        ethUsdPrice = values[1];

        priceTimestamp = block.timestamp - THREE_MINUTES;
    }
```
This absence of access restrictions is the root cause, as it permits any external entity to update critical price data without verification.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An external actor needs to call `updatePrice()` to set `assetUsdPrice` and `ethUsdPrice` to manipulated values.
2. The `priceTimestamp` needs to be updated to a recent time to make the manipulated prices appear valid.
3. The system relying on the oracle needs to automatically accept the updated prices without performing additional validation checks.

### External pre-conditions

No specific external pre-conditions are required, as the primary issue is internal due to the lack of access control.

### Attack Path

1. An unauthorized actor calls the `updatePrice()` function due to the absence of access control.
2. The actor inputs manipulated data, which is processed by `getOracleNumericValuesFromTxMsg(dataFeedIds)`, resulting in incorrect `assetUsdPrice` and `ethUsdPrice`.
3. The function updates `priceTimestamp` to the current time, making the manipulated prices appear recent and legitimate.
4. Systems relying on the oracle automatically accept and use the updated prices without additional validation.

#### Example: lets say
- The manipulated `assetUsdPrice` is significantly lower than the actual market price. The protocol uses this incorrect price to evaluate collateral values.
- As a result, borrowers collateral appears undervalued, triggering unnecessary liquidations.
- Borrowers suffer financial losses due to these liquidations, and the protocol is damaged due to inaccurate price feeds.

### Impact

The protocol will suffers loss of  funds in collateral value due to manipulated price data, leading to unnecessary liquidations. The attacker gains funds by exploiting arbitrage opportunities created by the incorrect pricing.

 
### Mitigation

- Implement role-based access control for the `updatePrice()` function to ensure only authorized entities can update price data, reducing the risk of unauthorized manipulation.
