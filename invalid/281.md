# Users can artificially boost their chances of liquidations reverting

## Summary
Users can artificially boost their chances of liquidations reverting
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon liquidations, we calculate the total collateral value a user has in ETH using an oracle:
```solidity
function _getPositionAssetData(address position)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256, address[] memory, uint256[] memory)
    {
        uint256 totalAssetValue;

        address[] memory positionAssets = Position(payable(position)).getPositionAssets();
        uint256 positionAssetsLength = positionAssets.length;
        uint256[] memory positionAssetData = new uint256[](positionAssetsLength);

        for (uint256 i; i < positionAssetsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 assets = getAssetValue(position, positionAssets[i]);
            // positionAssetData[i] stores value of positionAssets[i] in eth
            positionAssetData[i] = assets;
            totalAssetValue += assets;
        }

        if (totalAssetValue == 0) return (0, positionAssets, positionAssetData);

        for (uint256 i; i < positionAssetsLength; ++i) {
            // positionAssetData[i] stores weight of positionAsset[i]
            // wt of positionAsset[i] = (value of positionAsset[i]) / (total position assets value)
            positionAssetData[i] = positionAssetData[i].mulDiv(1e18, totalAssetValue);
        }

        return (totalAssetValue, positionAssets, positionAssetData);
    }
```
```solidity
    function getAssetValue(address position, address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
        IOracle oracle = IOracle(riskEngine.getOracleFor(asset));
        uint256 amt = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(position);
        return oracle.getValueInEth(asset, amt);
    }
```
For a token to be included as collateral, the user just has to call `PositionManager::addToken()` with the according input data. The issue with that is that the user does not have to deposit any tokens in order for that token to be used as collateral. This means that upon the value of collateral being calculated using the functions above, we could go through tokens that serve absolutely no purpose as the balance of them is 0. However, as we use an oracle for every single one of them, this makes the chance of the function reverting much higher as it would use different price feeds that might have a stale price, inactive sequencer, etc. This makes the chance of a liquidation reverting much more likely for absolutely no cost of the user.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Whenever an amount of the token is 0, do not call the oracle but just continue. Alternatively, do not allow tokens to be added as collateral if their balance is 0.
