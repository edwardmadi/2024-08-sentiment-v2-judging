# Invalid check of poolCap while reallocating assets.

## Summary
While reallocating assets from  `withdraws`  to `deposits`  ,  poolcap check is wrongly  implemetned.Hence reallocate bot cant reallocate assets effciently.

## Vulnerability Detail

while reallocating , If the `assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets` reached `poolCap` , the loop skips the current pool.

```solidity
            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
```

It contradict the fact that assets can be deposited at a maximum of poolCap (includes poolCap) which is also checked in other functions like deposit.

## Impact
Assets cant be deposited to the pools in `deposits` while reallocating if the `assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets` reached `poolCap`   .
