# The conditional check for poolCap in the reallocate() function is incorrect.



## Summary
The conditional check for SuperPool.poolCap in the reallocate() function is incorrect, which could result in a reduction of profits for stakers.
## Vulnerability Detail
```javascript
    function reallocate(ReallocateParams[] calldata withdraws, ReallocateParams[] calldata deposits) external {
        if (!isAllocator[msg.sender] && msg.sender != Ownable.owner()) {
            revert SuperPool_OnlyAllocatorOrOwner(address(this), msg.sender);
        }

        uint256 withdrawsLength = withdraws.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < withdrawsLength; ++i) {
            if (poolCapFor[withdraws[i].poolId] == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(withdraws[i].poolId);
            POOL.withdraw(withdraws[i].poolId, withdraws[i].assets, address(this), address(this));
        }

        uint256 depositsLength = deposits.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositsLength; ++i) {
@>>            uint256 poolCap = poolCapFor[deposits[i].poolId];
            // disallow deposits to pool not associated with this SuperPool
            if (poolCap == 0) revert SuperPool_PoolNotInQueue(deposits[i].poolId);
            // respect pool cap
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(deposits[i].poolId, address(this));
@>>            if (assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets < poolCap) {
                ASSET.approve(address(POOL), deposits[i].assets);
                POOL.deposit(deposits[i].poolId, deposits[i].assets, address(this));
            }
        }
    }
```

```javascript
function _supplyToPools(uint256 assets) internal {
        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
            uint256 poolId = depositQueue[i];
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));

            if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
@>>                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool;
                if (assets < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = assets;
                ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

                // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
                try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                    assets -= supplyAmt;
                } catch { }

                if (assets == 0) return;
            }
        }
    }
```

Firstly, we can observe that when assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets == poolCap, these deposits[i].assets should be staked in the BasePool. Skipping this part of the staking results in a loss of share profits for the SuperPool. Furthermore, by comparing the intended usage of poolCapFor in the _supplyToPools function (where supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool), it further confirms that poolCap represents the maximum value that the SuperPool can stake into the pool.

Secondly, even if assetsInPool + deposits[i].assets > poolCap, the staking can still be completed by adjusting the value of deposits[i].assets in the code, such as deposits[i].assets = poolCap - assetsInPool. 

## Impact
Due to the incorrect conditional check, this part of the assets is skipped from being staked, which results in a loss of share profits for the SuperPool.

```diff
-           if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) 
+           if (assetsInPool < = poolCapFor[poolId])
