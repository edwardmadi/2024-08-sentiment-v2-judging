# SuperPool#Deposit() might return less shares than `SuperPool#previewDeposit()`

## Summary
feeShares is used when calculating shares in `SuperPool#previewDeposit()` But omitted when calculating shares in SuperPool#Deposit()
## Vulnerability Detail
in `SuperPool#previewDeposit()`, when calculating shares feeShares is added to totalSupply()
```solidity
    function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 feeShares, uint256 newTotalAssets) = simulateAccrue();
        return _convertToShares(assets, newTotalAssets, totalSupply() + feeShares, Math.Rounding.Down);
    }
```

whilst in `SuperPool#Deposit()`,  feeShares isn't added to totalSupply when calculating for shares 
```solidity
function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
```

So in `#previewDeposit()` assets is * by `totalSupply()` + `feeShares`, while in `#deposit()` assets is * by only `totalSupply()`.

This will result in a scenario where  #deposit() will return less shares as #previewDeposit() if called in the same transaction, this breaks ERC4626 compliancy


check `previewDeposit()` second line -   https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#methods

**MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of Vault shares that would be minted in a deposit call in the same transaction. I.e. deposit should return the same or more shares as previewDeposit if called in the same transaction.**


## Impact
 #deposit() will return less shares as #previewDeposit() if called in the same transaction, this breaks ERC4626 compliancy

Manual Review

## Recommendation
in `#deposit()` assets should be  x by `totalSupply()` + feeShares when calculating for shares too.
