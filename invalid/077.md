# The user may be unable to complete the deposit

## Summary
stETH has a corner-case issue where the receiving account may receive slightly less than what was deposited, which can prevent the user from successfully depositing into the pool contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `SuperPool.deposit()` function, the protocol first transfers tokens into the `SuperPool` contract and then deposits these tokens into the pool. 
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Down);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareDeposit(address(this), assets);
        _deposit(receiver, assets, shares);
    }

```

According to the documentation's comment,
```solidity 
Tokens are whitelisted; only tokens with valid oracles can be used to create Base Pools.

```

 The protocol relies on an ETH-based oracle, and stETH has a corresponding oracle as well ([stETH Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x86392dC19c0b719886221c78AB11eb8Cf5c52812)). However, there is a known issue with stETH(https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case): due to rounding down, the stETH balance of an account could be lower by 1-2 wei. This rounding down issue is not only problematic when displaying the balance but also affects transfers. When transferring an amount from account A to account B, account B might receive a slightly lesser amount.

As a result, when the protocol transfers tokens from the user to the `SuperPool`, the `SuperPool` may receive fewer tokens than expected due to rounding down. When the protocol later attempts to deposit the tokens into the pool, it approves the exact amount of assets that the user transferred. However, due to the rounding issue, this may cause the deposit to fail, preventing the user from successfully completing the deposit.
```solidity
 function _supplyToPools(uint256 assets) internal {
        uint256 depositQueueLength = depositQueue.length;
        console.log("depositQueueLength:",depositQueueLength);
        for (uint256 i; i < depositQueueLength; ++i) {
            console.log(i);
            uint256 poolId = depositQueue[i];
            uint256 assetsInPool = POOL.getAssetsOf(poolId, address(this));

            if (assetsInPool < poolCapFor[poolId]) {
                uint256 supplyAmt = poolCapFor[poolId] - assetsInPool;
                if (assets < supplyAmt) supplyAmt = assets;
                ASSET.forceApprove(address(POOL), supplyAmt);

                // skip and move to the next pool in queue if deposit reverts
                try POOL.deposit(poolId, supplyAmt, address(this)) {
                    assets -= supplyAmt;
                } catch { }

                if (assets == 0) return;
            }
        }
    }

```

## Impact
The user is unable to complete the deposit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the amount received before the transfer and after the transfer to check the actual amount received by the protocol. Then, use the actual received amount for the calculations.
