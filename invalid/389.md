# If `Pool::defaultInterestFee` is 0, depositors can borrow against themselves to DOS pool withdrawals

## Summary

Users must be able to trust the pool owner, but not other depositors in the same pool. But if the `defaultInterestFee` is set to 0, a borrower can borrow against their own capital up to the `poolCap` to DOS pool withdrawals for other users.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the [readme](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/349) `defaultInterestFee` has a range of permitted values from 0 to 10%. The `defaultInterestFee` represents the [`interestFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L585) that is set when a pool is initialized. 

The `interestFee` pool parameter is used to calculate how many `feeAssets` the `feeRecipient` should recieve, and in turn how many `feeShares` should be [minted to the `feeRecipient`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L385-L395). If set to 0, [no fees shares will be minted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L386). 


In this case, 100% of the `interestAccrued` is passed onto depositors because `pool.totalBorrowAssets` and `pool.totalDepositAssets` are incremented by the same value.

```javascript
    function accrue(PoolData storage pool, uint256 id) internal {
        (uint256 interestAccrued, uint256 feeShares) = simulateAccrue(pool);

        if (feeShares != 0) _mint(feeRecipient, id, feeShares);

        // update pool state
        pool.totalDepositShares += feeShares; // feeShares is 0 in this case
@>      pool.totalBorrowAssets += interestAccrued;
@>      pool.totalDepositAssets += interestAccrued;

        ... SKIP!...
    }
```

The issue is that a position controlled by a pool depositor can borrow against their own liquidity for free (no fees and interest paid by the attcker will be equal to interest earned). If they do this at the required volume to bring the pool to it's cap, it will block withdrawals for regular users. The amount available to with is [capped to the available liquidity in the pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L359-L362).

To withdraw funds from the pool, regular users will need to wait for repayments to create available liquidty. However in the case of large depositors waiting to withdraw, upon repayments there will be a race conditions to withdraw.

Some other details that make this DOS attack viable:
- There is no deadline for positions to repay debt, consequenctly there is no deadline on how long a large pool deposit could be DOSed
- There is no minimum value that a `poolCap` can be set. Due to the permissionless nature of setting up a pool, there will be many pools where this attack is possible.
- The attacker will need to deposit extra collateral, this is small relative to the borrow size given they can swap the borrowed funds into an approved collateral asset, and the LTV can be set to as high as 98%
- The attacker's deposit into the pool is still capital efficient as they can utilize the borrowed funds in defi to earn yield through `exec()`.
- According the the contest readme, the planned `defaultOriginationFee` is 0 in the planned deployment


## Impact

- Pool withdrawals can be DOSed for free if the attacker has sufficient capital to reach the pool's cap.
- Race conditions will be created to withdraw when liquidity becomes available. Possible impacts of this are the pool shares trading at less than their potentially redeemable value.

## Recommendation

- Only allow `defaultInterestFee` paramater to be set > 0 to ensure there is non-trivial costs for this attack.
