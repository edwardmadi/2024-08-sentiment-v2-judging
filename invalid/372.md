# Virtual supply shares steal interest of actual suppliers

## Summary
The virtual supply shares, that are not owned by anyone, implicitly earn interest as the shares-to-asset conversions used in `withdraw` involve the virtual assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_convertToShares` function is designed to handle vault inflation attacks by adding virtual shares to the actual shares and then doing the further calculations

```solidity
 function _convertToShares(
        uint256 _assets,
        uint256 _totalAssets,
        uint256 _totalShares,
        Math.Rounding _rounding
    ) public view virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
        shares = _assets.mulDiv(_totalShares + 1, _totalAssets + 1, _rounding);
    }
```

Now if we see the `withdraw` function it is calculating the `shares` by calling `_convertToShares` :

```solidity
 function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner) public nonReentrant returns (uint256 shares) {
        accrue();
        shares = _convertToShares(assets, lastTotalAssets, totalSupply(), Math.Rounding.Up);
        if (shares == 0) revert SuperPool_ZeroShareWithdraw(address(this), assets);
        _withdraw(receiver, owner, assets, shares);
    }
```

This interest is stolen from the actual suppliers which leads to loss of interest funds for users. 
The readMe states that :
`The SuperPool is heavily inspired from and modified from Yearn v3 and Metamorpho vault designs`
Which means they have taken this design decision from the `Metamorpho` vault design which implements the same design but also has the same bug in place.


I'm attaching a screenshot of a finding from Cantina's audit of Metamorpho vault in which the same bug was existent.

## Impact
Over time and with more transactions, these small discrepancies accumulate, leading to more significant losses for users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 The virtual shares should not earn interest as they don't correspond to any supplier.
