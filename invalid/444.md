# Timelock Bypass

Medium 

## Summary
The contract uses timelock to delay the application of LTV updates. However, the requestLtvUpdate function allows immediate LTV updates if the previous LTV was zero. This could be exploited by an attacker who could intentionally set an LTV to zero and then immediately update it to an arbitrary value without waiting for the timelock.

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker who has compromised a pool owner's account sets the LTV if an asset to zero. Immediately, the attacker can propose a new LTV, bypassing the timelock restrictions, which could be set to an extremely high value to allow over borrowing.

## Impact
If an attacker bypasses the timelock and sets an LTV from 0% to 90%, users can borrow up to $9 million or $10 million collateral base, potentially leading to losses of $3 million if collateral value drops 20%

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
-Ensure that any LTV update, regardless of current LTV, require the timelock period to pass before being applied.
- Introduce a minimum delay for setting LTV to zero, where any subsequent updates must still respect the timelock duration.
