# Position owners can accidentally lock themselves out


## Summary
The `toggleAuth` function allows the position owner to authorize other users to operate on the position. However, this could lead to issues if the position owner accidentally or maliciously authorizes an unintended address. There's no event emitted after the authorization toggle, making it harder to track.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `toggleAuth` function is used to toggle (enable or disable) authorization for a given user to interact with a specified position.
The function checks if the caller (`msg.sender`) is the `owner` of the position before toggling the authorization status for a specified user (`user`).
However, the function allows the `owner` to call `toggleAuth` on their own address, which would toggle their authorization status as well.
If the owner accidentally calls this function with their own address as user, they would disable their own authorization to manage the position.

## Impact
Once the `owner` disables their own authorization, they would be unable to perform any actions on the position that require authorization, effectively locking themselves out of managing their own position.

There is no mechanism in place to prevent this scenario or to allow the owner to reauthorize themselves if they accidentally lock themselves out.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L217-L224

```javascript 
[protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol]
217     function toggleAuth(address user, address position) external { // @audit - msg sender can lock himself out
218         // only account owners are allowed to modify authorizations
219         // disables transitive auth operations
220         if (msg.sender != ownerOf[position]) revert PositionManager_OnlyPositionOwner(position, msg.sender);
221 
222         // update authz status in storage
223         isAuth[position][user] = !isAuth[position][user];
224     }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent the owner from accidentally disabling their own authorization, the function could include a check to ensure that the owner cannot toggle authorization for themselves:
```diff 
+       event AuthorizationToggled(address indexed position, address indexed user, bool isAuthorized);

        function toggleAuth(address user, address position) external {
                // only account owners are allowed to modify authorizations
                if (msg.sender != ownerOf[position]) revert PositionManager_OnlyPositionOwner(position, msg.sender);
                
+               // Prevent the owner from toggling their own authorization
+               if (user == msg.sender) revert("Cannot disable self-authorization");

                // update authz status in storage
                isAuth[position][user] = !isAuth[position][user];

+               // Emit the event with the new status
+               emit AuthorizationToggled(position, user, newAuthStatus);
        }
```
