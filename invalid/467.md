# Unchecked External Call Vulnerability in exec() function

High

## Summary
The exec function allows positions to execute arbitrary calls to external contracts. However, it does not check the return value of these external calls, which can lead to unintended behaviour if call fails silently.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor could cause a critical external call to fail silently, leading to the Position Manager state being inconsistent. For instance, the external call might perform an important transfer or update, and its failure could lead to under-collateralization or over-borrowing without proper detection.

## Impact
Could lead to under-collateralization or over-borrowing

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check for the success of the external call using the return data to ensure it's executed successfully
