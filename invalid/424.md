# Solidity version 0.8.23 or greater wont be compatible on Mantle L2

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The current codebase is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.24 or greater. According to the README, 
>On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
>Any EVM-compatible network

so the protocol can be deployed on the Mantle network as all EVM compatible chains are stated, but according to the documentation of Mantle network,

>Currently Mantle doesn't support the latest version of the Solidity. Make sure your Solidity compiler version is lower than v0.8.23 when you deploy the contract.

So the current code is not compatible

## Impact
The protocol is not deployable due to the current solidity version

Manual Review

## Recommendation
for Mantle you may consider to use version lower than 0.8.23 to compile.
