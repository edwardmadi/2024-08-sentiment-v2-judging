# User can Borrow Without Providing Actual Collateral

### Summary

A missing validation in the `PositionManager` contract will cause a free borrowing issue for the protocol as a user can add the borrowed asset as collateral and borrow without providing actual collateral.


### Root Cause

In `protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol` the [`addToken` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L405-L415) allows adding any asset as collateral, including the borrowed asset.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio to 1 for the borrowed asset.
2. User needs to call [`addToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L405-L415) to add the borrowed asset as collateral.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets the LTV ratio to 1 for the borrowed asset.
2. User calls [`addToken`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L405-L415) to add the borrowed asset as collateral.
3. User calls `borrow` to borrow assets from the pool.
4. The health check in `RiskModule` incorrectly considers the borrowed assets as collateral, allowing the user to borrow without providing actual collateral.


### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of all assets in the pool as the user can borrow without providing actual collateral. The attacker gains all the borrowed assets.

### PoC

1. Admin sets the LTV ratio to 1 for the borrowed asset.
2. User calls `addToken` to add the borrowed asset as collateral:
   ```solidity
   PositionManager.addToken(position, abi.encodePacked(borrowedAsset));
   ```
3. User calls `borrow` to borrow assets from the pool:
   ```solidity
   PositionManager.borrow(position, abi.encodePacked(poolId, borrowAmount));
   ```
4. The health check in `RiskModule` incorrectly considers the borrowed assets as collateral, allowing the user to borrow without providing actual collateral.

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, the protocol should not allow the borrowed asset to be used as collateral. This can be enforced by adding a check in the `addToken` function to ensure the asset being added as collateral is not the same as the borrowed asset.

```diff
function addToken(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
    address asset = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));

+   // Ensure the asset being added as collateral is not the same as the borrowed asset
+   uint256[] memory debtPools = Position(payable(position)).getDebtPools();
+   for (uint256 i = 0; i < debtPools.length; ++i) {
+       if (pool.getPoolAssetFor(debtPools[i]) == asset) {
+           revert PositionManager_AddUnknownToken(asset);
+       }
+   }

    if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_AddUnknownToken(asset);

    Position(payable(position)).addToken(asset);
    emit AddToken(position, msg.sender, asset);
}
```
