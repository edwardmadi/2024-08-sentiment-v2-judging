# Lack of Slippage Protection in deposit() and transfer()

Medium 

## Summary
The deposit and transfer functions do not include any checks for slippage. If there is a significant price fluctuation between the time the user initiates a deposit or transfer and when the transaction is executed, the user might receive less value than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious actor could manipulate the market to cause significant slippage, leading to users receiving less value than they intended.

## Impact
Users could receive less than they intended
