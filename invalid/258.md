# A position that got blacklisted by USDC/USDT still can use USDC/USDT in its balance as an asset

### Summary

A position that got blacklisted by USDC/USDT still can use USDC/USDT in its balance as an asset.

### Root Cause

If a position got blacklisted by USDC/USDT, its USDC/USDT balance still be considered as an asset in `RiskModule#isPositionHealthy`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The position already has USDC/USDT in its balance before getting blacklisted by USDC/USDT

### External pre-conditions

1. The position got blacklisted by USDC/USDT

### Attack Path

1. The position owner still can call to `PositionManager#process` with `Operation.Borrow` to borrow tokens other than USDC/USDT. The USDC/USDT in the position's balance still be considered as an asset to back other tokens.

### Impact

- In `RiskModule#isPositionHealthy`, `totalAssetValue` will be wrongly accounted, because it still includes USDC/USDT in its calculation. This leads to the position is healthier than its real value. The correct calculation would be excluding USDC/USDT balance from `totalAssetValue`.
- Since the position is healthier, the position can borrow more than its real asset, the liquidation process will happen later than it should be.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- In `PositionManager#borrow`, add a check to ensure that a position is not (blacklisted by USDC/USDT and having USDC/USDT as asset)
- In `PositionManager`, add a permissionless function to remove USDC/USDT as asset from a position if it got blacklisted by USDC/USDT.
