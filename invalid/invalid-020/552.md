# Incorrect Fee Validation in `SuperPool` contract Constructor

## Summary
The constructor of the `SuperPool` contract contains a logical error where it checks the uninitialized `fee` variable instead of the `fee_` parameter, potentially leading to incorrect fee validation during contract deployment.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor of the `SuperPool` contract, the line `if (fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();` is intended to ensure that the initial fee does not exceed 100%. However, it mistakenly references the fee state variable, which hasn't been initialized at this point, instead of the `fee_` parameter provided during deployment. This oversight means that the intended validation is not performed correctly, and the contract might be deployed with an invalid fee setting.

## Impact
This issue can lead to the deployment of the contract with a fee that exceeds the intended maximum of 100%, potentially resulting in incorrect fee calculations and financial discrepancies for users interacting with the SuperPool.
