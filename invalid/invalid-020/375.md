# In the function `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate()`, the validation is performed upon a wrong variable

## Summary
In the function `SuperPool::requestFeeUpdate()`, it is supposed to validate the input of `_fee` against `1e18`; however, the code is checking the `fee` which is not the intention.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the `requestFeeUpdate()` function where there's an improper condition check regarding the `fee` value, intended to guard against excessively high fees. The condition checks if the current `fee` is greater than `1e18`, but it should actually check the proposed `_fee` input to the function.

## Impact
This line of validation is supposed to guard against excessively high fees input, but now it is totally not working. Without this guard, an excessively high fee in effect can lead to severe financial damage to the users, so it ought to be a **HIGH** issue; however, on the other hand, this function is `onlyOwner`(or the `constructor`), so by default we trust the owner and take it as a **LOW** likelihood for the human errors by the owner. Therefore, all things considered, this bug should have a fair **MEDIUM** severity.

## Code Snippet
The bug is in this line of code below:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should be changed to:
```solidity
        if (_fee > 1e18) revert SuperPool_FeeTooHigh();
```
