# Pool utilization of 100% is dangerous

## Summary
Pools can reach 100% utilization, which is dangerous as it prevents LP providers from withdrawing their assets, effectively locking them in the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L420-L474) function has only one check that ensures the borrowing amount won't push utilization above 100%.

```solidity
        uint256 assetsInPool = pool.totalDepositAssets - pool.totalBorrowAssets;
        if (assetsInPool < amt) revert Pool_InsufficientBorrowLiquidity(poolId, assetsInPool, amt);
```

This means **borrowers can borrow up to `totalBorrowAssets`, resulting in 100% utilization**. This is problematic for LP providers who prioritize liquidity, as they **won't be able to withdraw their assets** for a long time.

This issue can be further exacerbated by the [setPoolCap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L609-L613) function, which allows the pool cap to be lowered instantly. If the pool owner (a potentially untrusted entity) lowers the pool cap while the pool is at 100% utilization, it would prevent new deposits from adding liquidity while still allowing borrowers to take loans, even if `poolCap < totalAssets == totalBorrows`.

In this scenario, utilization would exceed 100% because `poolCap < totalBorrows`, but it would still be calculated as the difference between `totalAssets` and `totalBorrows`.

## Impact
LP providers may have their deposits stuck for an extended period, leading to low pool liquidity.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function borrow(uint256 poolId, address position, uint256 amt) external returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
        PoolData storage pool = poolDataFor[poolId];

        if (pool.isPaused) revert Pool_PoolPaused(poolId);
        if (msg.sender != positionManager) revert Pool_OnlyPositionManager(poolId, msg.sender);
        if (_getValueOf(pool.asset, amt) < minBorrow) revert Pool_BorrowAmountTooLow(poolId, pool.asset, amt);

        accrue(pool, poolId);

        uint256 assetsInPool = pool.totalDepositAssets - pool.totalBorrowAssets;
        if (assetsInPool < amt) revert Pool_InsufficientBorrowLiquidity(poolId, assetsInPool, amt);

        borrowShares = _convertToShares(amt, pool.totalBorrowAssets, pool.totalBorrowShares, Math.Rounding.Up);

        if (borrowShares == 0) revert Pool_ZeroSharesBorrow(poolId, amt);

        uint256 newBorrowAssets = _convertToAssets(
            borrowSharesOf[poolId][position] + borrowShares,
            pool.totalBorrowAssets + amt,
            pool.totalBorrowShares + borrowShares,
            Math.Rounding.Down
        );

        if (_getValueOf(pool.asset, newBorrowAssets) < minDebt) {
            revert Pool_DebtTooLow(poolId, pool.asset, newBorrowAssets);
        }

        pool.totalBorrowAssets += amt;
        pool.totalBorrowShares += borrowShares;
        borrowSharesOf[poolId][position] += borrowShares;

        uint256 fee = amt.mulDiv(pool.originationFee, 1e18);
        address asset = pool.asset;
        if (fee > 0) IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(feeRecipient, fee);

        IERC20(asset).safeTransfer(position, amt - fee);
        emit Borrow(position, poolId, asset, amt);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Implement a TVL mechanism that prevents borrowers from borrowing 100% of the lender's assets.
