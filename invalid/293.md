# Unvalidated `superPoolCap` in `SuperPoolFactory` Deployment of SuperPools


## Reference
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/SuperPoolFactory.sol#L56
## Summary
The `deploySuperPool` function in the `SuperPoolFactory` contract does not validate the input for `superPoolCap`. This issue allows the cap to be set to zero or an extremely low value, potentially leading to disruption in protocol operations or misuse by attackers.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `deploySuperPool` function allows the creation of `SuperPools` without validating the value of `superPoolCap`, permitting it to be set to zero or an unusually low amount. This issue can be exploited by deploying SuperPools that effectively lock users out of making meaningful deposits. Without a minimum cap validation, such pools could become non-functional. This issue could result in liquidity being locked up, disrupting the entire protocol. Additionally, malicious actors might create SuperPools to manipulate market conditions or impede competitors.
## Impact
If `superPoolCap` is set to zero or a very low value, it would render the SuperPool non-operational by preventing any significant deposits. This could be exploited to lock liquidity, causing disruption to the protocol, affecting market conditions, and leading to potential economic loss. Additionally, it opens up avenues for malicious actors to create ineffective or unusable SuperPools, impacting overall protocol health.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement validation for the `superPoolCap` parameter to ensure it cannot be set to zero or a value below a reasonable threshold. This validation will prevent the creation of non-functional SuperPools and maintain the protocol's operational integrity.
