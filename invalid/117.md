# Chain reorg will cause loss of funds for the depositors of SuperPool

### Summary

Chain-reorg will cause depositors of `SuperPool` to deposit in wrong pool if creation of superpool and deposits is done in re-org blocks

### Root Cause

No check present in `deposit` function of `SuperPool` to ensure that the `pool` is indeed the user wants to deposit

### Internal pre-conditions


_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Block re-org should happen.

### Attack Path

* `Alice` deploys a new `SuperPool` with small valid `fee` and `feeRecipient` set to `Alice`.
* `Alice` or other users deposits in the pool created by `Alice`.
* Bob has an active bot that observes the blockchain and alerts in reorg.

Once the reorg happens
* `Bob` deploys a new `SuperPool` large `fee` and `feeRecipient` set to `Bob`.
* `Alice` or other users deposits in the pool created by `Bob`.
* Thus an `SuperPool` is created with an address to which Alice or other users sends tokens.



### Impact

The users would have deposited to wrong `SuperPool` than what they intend to do.
