# Deposited ETH are locked in the Position contract and borrower has no way to transfer them out.

## Summary
Native token which is used for the ```exec()``` function of ```Position``` contract can remain locked for ever if the ```exec()``` revert and user is not willing to call it again after new circumstances.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability occurs when deposited ETH in the Position contract becomes locked with no available mechanism for the borrower to transfer it out . This happens due to the absence of a``` transferOut```(or something similar) function in the contract, which prevents borrowers from retrieving their deposited ETH under certain conditions, such as loan liquidation. Also, it is possible for a user who sends ETH only if he has an ```exec``` to do, to have his ETH locked in the Position contract because the ```exec``` reverted (like a leverage trade that failed). In this case, the user will not be able to transfer out his ETH while they do not want to use them anymore. 

## Impact
Deposited ETH that users transfer so to use them but eventually can't be used will remain locked for ever in Position contract.

## Code Snippet
Here is the ```receive``` function of ```Position``` contract :
```solidity
    // positions can receive and hold ether to perform external operations.
    // ether is otherwise ignored by the rest of the protocol. it does not count
    // towards the position balance, pools cannot lend ether and it cannot be
    // used as collateral to borrow other assets
    receive() external payable { }
```

And here is the ```exec``` function of ```Position``` contract  which is supposed to use the native token in the ```value``` : 
```solidity
    /// @notice Intereact with external contracts using arbitrary calldata
    /// @dev Target and calldata is validated by the position manager
    function exec(address target, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external onlyPositionManager {
        (bool success,) = target.call{ value: value }(data);
        if (!success) revert Position_ExecFailed(address(this), target);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Allow transfers out of deposited ETH.
