# The pool cap will be reached earlier than expected

## Summary
The pool cap will be reached earlier than expected
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon deposits, we enforce the pool cap like this:
```solidity
if (pool.totalDepositAssets + assets > pool.poolCap) revert Pool_PoolCapExceeded(poolId);
```
It aims to limit the depositted assets into the protocol based on the pool cap. The issue is that the pool cap also increases upon accruals of interest. This makes it so the cap will be reached a lot earlier than expected and the actual deposits users can make are much lower than the pool cap.
## Impact
The pool cap will be reached earlier than expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implement a secondary deposit assets counter variable that does not increment upon interest accruals and use that for the pool cap checks instead of the other one
