# Missing ETH-USD Feed on Certain Networks Limits Functionality of RedstoneCoreOracle Contract

## Summary
The `RedstoneCoreOracle` contract relies on external price feeds for ETH-USD, which are not available on some networks like Arbitrum. This limitation affects the contract's ability to function as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract's `updatePrice()` function depends on the availability of the ETH-USD feed to update and calculate asset prices. On networks where this feed is unavailable, the contract cannot perform its core functionality, leading to potential failures or incorrect pricing.

## Impact
- The contract cannot update prices on networks lacking the ETH-USD feed.
- Users may experience incorrect price calculations or inability to use the contract.
- Limits the contract's deployment and functionality across different networks.
