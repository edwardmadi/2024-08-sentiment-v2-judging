# Borrowers can avoid origination fees by borrowing dust amounts

### Summary

The fee calculation in the [`Pool::borrow` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L420-L475) rounds down, allowing borrowers to avoid paying origination fees by borrowing small amounts multiple times. This will cause a loss of fees for the protocol as borrowers can exploit this rounding behavior.

### Root Cause

In [`protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol: borrow` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L420-L475), the fee calculation `amt.mulDiv(pool.originationFee, 1e18)` rounds down, which can result in a zero fee for small borrow amounts.


### Internal pre-conditions

 The borrower needs to call the [`borrow` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/Pool.sol#L420-L475) with a small amount that, when multiplied by the origination fee and divided by 1e18, results in a fee of zero.


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The borrower calls the `borrow` function with a small amount (dust amount).
2. The fee calculation rounds down, resulting in a zero fee.
3. The borrower repeats this process multiple times to avoid paying origination fees.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of origination fees. The borrower gains by avoiding the fees that should have been paid for borrowing.

### PoC

1. Assume `originationFee` is 0.01e18 (1%).
2. The borrower calls `borrow` with an amount of 99 units.
3. The fee calculation: `99 * 0.01e18 / 1e18 = 0.99 = 0` (rounded down).
4. The borrower pays zero fees for borrowing 99 units.
5. The borrower repeats this process to avoid paying fees.

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, the fee calculation should be modified to round up, ensuring that a non-zero fee is always charged for borrowing.

### Code Fix:
```diff
function borrow(uint256 poolId, address position, uint256 amt) external returns (uint256 borrowShares) {
    // ... existing code ...

    // compute origination fee amt
-   uint256 fee = amt.mulDiv(pool.originationFee, 1e18);
+   uint256 fee = amt.mulDiv(pool.originationFee, 1e18, Math.Rounding.Up);

    // ... existing code ...
}
```
