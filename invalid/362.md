# Malicious pool owner can redirect funds of super pool, from other base pools, into their pool

### Summary

Depositing and withdrawing mechanics will cause low liquidity for some pools as malicious pool owners can redirect liquidity, provided from super pool, into their own pools.

### Root Cause

- The choice to supply to and withdraw funds from the queues (deposit queue and withdrawal queue) sequentially might not be a good choice since it allows users with huge funds (whales or flashloans) to manipulate liquidity of base pools. When huge withdrawals happen, the frontmost pools in the withdrawal queu will have the highest risk of being empty/ low liquidity.
- Combining with the fact that users could deposit then withdraw right after makes this attack even more viable, for malicious attackers could use flashloans to manipulate the liquidity of base pools for free.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is at least a pool with asset of superpool in it.
2. Use default queues (default deposit queue + default withdraw queue)

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. There is at least a pool (pool A) in the deposit pool with some funds of super pool depositing into it.
2. A new pool (pool B) is added. Default deposit queue is now [A B]. Default withdrawal queue is also [A B]
3. Pool B owner uses a flashloan to deposit a huge amount of asset into and then withdraw it from super pool.
4. Because withdrawal queue is [A B], all liquidity of super pool from A will be removed first before B. Thus, the remaining asset of super pool will end up in pool B. Pool B owner has successfully transfer liquidity from pool A to his pool.

### Impact

Malicious base pool owners can redirect liquidity into their own pools, at the cost of low liquidity for other base pools. High liquidity will help these pools attract more borrowers, thus more profit in charging interest.

        assertEq(poolAFinalAmount, 0 ether);
        assertEq(asset1.balanceOf(poolOwner2), 100 ether);
        assertEq(poolBFinalAmount, 25 ether  + initialDepositAmt);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, we need to prevent users from withdrawing immediately after depositing.
