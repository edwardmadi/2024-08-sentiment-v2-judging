# Missing gap Variable in Upgradeable Contracts


## Reference

## Summary
The `Pool` & `PositionManager` contracts, designed as an upgradeable contract using OwnableUpgradeable, lack gap variable. In upgradeable contracts, a gap variable is essential to reserve storage slots, allowing for seamless addition of new variables in future upgrades without causing storage collisions. This issue could lead to contract storage conflicts in future versions, resulting in incorrect behavior or vulnerabilities.
## Vulnerability Detail
Upgradeable contracts require a `gap` variable to leave unused storage slots in the contract. These slots are placeholders that allow new variables to be added without impacting the storage layout of inherited contracts. Without this gap, future upgrades might introduce variables that conflict with existing ones, causing unintended behavior.
## Impact
The lack of a gap variable in these contracts could lead to potential storage layout conflicts, especially in future versions where new variables are introduced. This can cause unexpected behavior, break the upgrade process, or even introduce new security vulnerabilities, severely impacting the contract's reliability.

## Recommendation
Introduce a gap variable to ensure smooth contract upgrades in the future.
