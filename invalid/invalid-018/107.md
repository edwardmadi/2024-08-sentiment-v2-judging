# Some assets may not have oracles

## Summary
Some assets may not have oracles, preventing them from being used inside the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
The system will use protocols like GMX and Pendle inside it's positions to provide extra yield. However the tokens from those protocols `fsGLP` and `PT Ethena USDe` respectfully, don't have oracles reporting their price. This means that they are effectively useless for the borrowers, as having them will require additional asset as collateral.

This can be especially true for Pendle as it will have 2 separate tokens (PT and YT) for every asset that is deposited into it.

## Impact
Most assets will lack oracles, making them useless for the system.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-sentiment-v2/blob/main/protocol-v2/src/PositionManager.sol#L326-L338
```solidity
    function deposit(address position, bytes calldata data) internal {
        address asset = address(bytes20(data[0:20]));
        uint256 amt = uint256(bytes32(data[20:52]));

        // mitigate unknown assets being locked in positions
        if (!isKnownAsset[asset]) revert PositionManager_DepositUnknownAsset(asset);

        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, position, amt);
        emit Deposit(position, msg.sender, asset, amt);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using more popular assets inside the system, such as stETH, sUSDe, etc.
