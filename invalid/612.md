# Insecure Management of Operator Permissions in Pool Contract

## Summary
The Pool contract contains a potential vulnerability related to the management of operator permissions. The `isOperator` mapping is used to control access, but the absence of explicit functions to securely manage this mapping could lead to unauthorized access or misuse. This oversight may result in operational confusion and potential security risks if not addressed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `isOperator` mapping is intended to track which addresses are authorized to act as operators for a given owner. However, without explicit functions to manage this mapping, there is no secure mechanism to add or remove operators. 

This lack of management functions means that the contract may not enforce permissions as intended, potentially allowing unauthorized users to perform actions that should be restricted.


An attacker could potentially manipulate the state of the contract (e.g., through direct storage manipulation in a broader system context or exploiting other contract interactions) to set themselves as an operator without the owner's consent.

## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for unauthorized access. If the `isOperator` mapping is used to grant permissions, the absence of secure management functions could allow unauthorized users to gain access to restricted functions or data. This could lead to financial loss or misuse of resources.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, implement explicit functions to securely manage the isOperator mapping, ensuring that only authorized users can modify operator statuses.
