# The SuperPool withdrawal queue can be bypassed

## Summary
See detail

## Vulnerability Detail
The SuperPool attempts to withdraw from base pools, sequentially according to the `withdrawQueue` order set by the creator.

However, it can only withdraw the available assets from each base pool.

Assume a SuperPool which provides liquidity to 3 base pools: $A, B, C$-  with the withdrawal queue in that order
Anyone with funds deposited in the SuperPool can bypass the intended withdrawal queue order in the following steps:

1. Get a large flash loan (with 0 fees)
2. Deposit the loaned tokens as collateral 
3. Borrow the maximum amount from pools $A$ and $B$
4. Withdraw from the SuperPool, funds will be withdrawn from $C$ since $A$ and $B$ have max utilisation
5. Repay the borrowed tokens from $A$ and $B$
6. Withdraw the collateral (0 interest since it is in the same transaction)
7. Repay the flash loan

## Impact
Intended withdrawal queue order is bypassed
