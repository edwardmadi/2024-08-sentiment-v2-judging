# Risk of Incorrect Asset Pricing by ChainlinkEthOracle and ChainlinkUsdOracle in Case of Underlying Aggregator Reaching lower than minAnswer

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).
## Vulnerability Detail
ChainlinkEthOracle and ChainlinkUsdOracle utilize the ChainlinkFeedRegistry to fetch the price of the requested tokens.
```solidity
function latestRoundData(
  address base,
  address quote
)
  external
  view
  override
  checkPairAccess()
  returns (
    uint80 roundId,
    int256 answer,
    uint256 startedAt,
    uint256 updatedAt,
    uint80 answeredInRound
  )
{
  uint16 currentPhaseId = s_currentPhaseId[base][quote];
  //@audit this pulls the Aggregator for the requested pair
  AggregatorV2V3Interface aggregator = _getFeed(base, quote);
  require(address(aggregator) != address(0), "Feed not found");
  (
    roundId,
    answer,
    startedAt,
    updatedAt,
    answeredInRound
  ) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
  return _addPhaseIds(roundId, answer, startedAt, updatedAt, answeredInRound, currentPhaseId);
}
```
ChainlinkFeedRegistry#latestRoundData pulls the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have minPrice and maxPrice circuit breakers built into them. This means that if the price of the asset drops below the minPrice, the protocol will continue to value the token at minPrice instead of it's actual value. This will allow users to take out huge amounts of bad debt and bankrupt the protocol.

Example:
TokenA has a minPrice of $1. The price of TokenA drops to $0.10. The aggregator still returns $1 allowing the user to borrow against TokenA as if it is $1 which is 10x it's actual value.

## Impact
In the event that an asset crashes (i.e. LUNA) the protocol can be manipulated to give out loans at an inflated price. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _getPriceWithSanityChecks(address asset) private view returns (uint256) {
        address feed = priceFeedFor[asset];
        // @audit-issue should check the price >= minPrice and price <= maxPrice; 
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IAggegregatorV3(feed).latestRoundData();
        if (price <= 0) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_NonPositivePrice(asset);
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - stalePriceThresholdFor[feed]) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_StalePrice(asset);
        return uint256(price);
    }
```

## Recommendation
```solidity
 (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IAggegregatorV3(feed).latestRoundData();
        if (price <= 0) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_NonPositivePrice(asset);
        if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - stalePriceThresholdFor[feed]) revert ChainlinkUsdOracle_StalePrice(asset);
        if (price >= maxPrice ||  price <= minPrice) revert();
        return uint256(price);
```
