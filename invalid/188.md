# Inconsistent Interest Accrual Mechanism in `FixedRateModel` and `LinearRateModel` Contracts

## Summary

The `FixedRateModel` and `LinearRateModel` contracts in the Sentiment protocol implement an inconsistent interest accrual mechanism. The current implementation combines aspects of simple and compound interest, leading to random interest amounts based on the frequency of interest updates.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The Sentiment protocol's interest rate calculation mechanism in both `FixedRateModel` and `LinearRateModel` contracts contains a  flaw in how interest is accrued over time. This issue stems from an incorrect implementation of interest calculation combined with the accumulation of interest into the `totalBorrows` parameter.

Let's examine the relevant code from the `FixedRateModel` contract:
```js
function getInterestAccrued(uint256 lastUpdated, uint256 totalBorrows, uint256) external view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 rateFactor = ((block.timestamp - lastUpdated)).mulDiv(RATE, SECONDS_PER_YEAR, Math.Rounding.Up);
    return totalBorrows.mulDiv(rateFactor, 1e18, Math.Rounding.Up);
}
```
- The issue lies in how the `getInterestAccrued` function calculates interest. It uses a simple interest formula applied on random  periods:

```Interest = Principal * Rate * Time```

Where:
- Principal is the `totalBorrows`
- Rate is the `interest rate`
- Time is the deltaTime since last update

This formula, when applied repeatedly with the interest being added to the principal (totalBorrows): 

- creates a random compound interest effect. this compounding is inconsistent and The total interest accrued over a fixed period can vary significantly based on how frequently the `getInterestAccrued` function is called.

- The crucial part of this issue is that the calculated interest is added to the totalBorrows parameter after each accrual. This means that subsequent interest calculations are performed on a principal that includes previously accrued interest, creating a compounding effect that was not correctly designed or implemented.
```js

    function accrue(PoolData storage pool, uint256 id) internal {
        (uint256 interestAccrued, uint256 feeShares) = simulateAccrue(pool);

        if (feeShares != 0) _mint(feeRecipient, id, feeShares);
        pool.totalDepositShares += feeShares;
        pool.totalBorrowAssets += interestAccrued;
 >>     pool.totalDepositAssets += interestAccrued;
        pool.lastUpdated = uint128(block.timestamp);
    }
```
Mathematically, this can be represented as:

For `n` periods:
```math
totalBorrows_n = totalBorrows_0 * (1 + R(t))^n
```
Where:
- **totalBorrows_0** is the initial borrowed amount
- **R(t)** is the rateFactor
- **n** is the number of periods

This formula results in different total interest amounts based on the number of compounding periods, which is determined by how frequently the `getInterestAccrued` function is called.

The correct approach should either:

1. Implement true compound interest:
  ```math 
   A = P * (1 + r)^t
   ```
   Where `A` is the final amount, P is the principal, `r` is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

2. Implement a non-compounding method:
   Keep a separate `totalBorrowPrincipal` that remains doesn't include intrestRate accrual, and calculate interest based on this fixed principal:
   ```math
   Interest = totalBorrowPrincipal * Rate * Time
   ```

The current implementation falls between these two approaches, creating an inconsistent  interest accrual mechanism. This issue  lead to unfair and unpredictable interest charges for users, as the total interest paid can vary based on factors outside of their control, such as how often the function accrue get called.

### example poc : 
Consider a scenario with a fixed interest rate of 20% APR and an initial borrowed amount of 1,000,000 units:
- we will be calculating the intrest accrual for 1 year , in three cases (this unrealistic but just to simplify the issue) : 
1. case 1 :  Annual update (accrue function called once a year)
   - Interest after 1 year: 1,000,000 * (0.2 * 1) = 200,000
   - Total borrowed after 1 year: 1,200,000

2. case 2 : Semi-annual updates (accrued function called twice a year)
   - Interest after 6 months: 1,000,000 * (0.2 * 0.5) = 100,000
   - Total borrowed after 6 months: 1,100,000
   - Interest for next 6 months: 1,100,000 * (0.2 * 0.5) = 110,000
   - Total borrowed after 1 year: 1,210,000

3. case 3 : Quarterly updates (accrued function called four times a year)
   - First quarter: 1,000,000 * (0.2 * 0.25) = 50,000
   - Second quarter: 1,050,000 * (0.2 * 0.25) = 52,500
   - Third quarter: 1,102,500 * (0.2 * 0.25) = 55,125
   - Fourth quarter: 1,157,625 * (0.2 * 0.25) = 57,881
   - Total borrowed after 1 year: 1,215,506

This example demonstrates how the same loan over the same period results in different total interest amounts based solely on the frequency of updates, highlighting the inconsistency in the current implementation.

## Impact

1. Inconsistent interest accrual for borrowers based on update frequency.
2. Undermined financial predictability and fairness of the lending protocol.
3. Potential for manipulation of interest payments through timed interactions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the interest calculation issue, the protocol should implement one of the following approaches:

1. True Compound Interest: Implement a proper compound interest formula using exponential calculations. This ensures consistent interest accrual regardless of update frequency.

2. Simple Interest with Fixed Principal: Maintain a separate totalBorrowPrincipal that remains constant. Calculate interest based on this fixed principal without compounding.

Either approach should be consistently applied in both `FixedRateModel` and `LinearRateModel` contracts.
